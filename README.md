# Kitfox Pilot's Operating Handbook

This handbook is based heavily on the venerable 1978 Cessna 152 Pilot's Operating Handbook.  It follows the same format and includes many of the same sections, subsections, graphs, diagrams, and procedures.  It should be familiar to most pilots. 

I'd like to extend my thanks to the nameless Cessna engineers to put so much effort into the original handbook lo these many decades ago.

That said, this is a new, and wholly separate handbook specifically for my Kitfox Series 7 STi, N137DF.  

I've placed this handbook under the Creative Commons Copyleft and made it freely available to everyone as long as you maintain my name in the credits.

## How to Use This Handbook for your Kitfox

Take it and edit it for your airplane! That's it! 

This manual is specific to the following Kitfox configuration:

- STi wing (changes CG range)
- Rotax 915iS engine (Changes CG range and gross weight)
- Garmin panel with PFD, MFD, and autopilot as built by Kitfox 
- Extended baggage compartment (Changes CG range)

It is highly recommended that you obtain a copy of the EAA Flight Test Manual Version 2 and Test Cards, and proceed through Phase I flight testing in the following order.  Folks have done Phase I in as little as 15 hours using this schedule and combining several cards into the same flight, i.e., Vx and Vy can be combined with Best L/D, etc.  For instance, I was able to proceed through the Light weight and Aft CG task cards in a single day, flying 2 flights over 4 hours.

1) Perform the preliminary test cards in the "Any" Test Weight and CG category.
2) Configure the plane in a Light weight and Forward CG.
3) Configure the plane in the Light weight and Aft CG.
4) Configure the plane in Heavy, 1550lb at takeoff, and Forward CG limit.
5) Configure the plane in the Heavy and Aft CG limit.

## Using the Range & Endurance Spreadsheet.

At each weight and CG configuration, fly the plane for 3-4 minutes at 30%, 40%, 50%, etc. power settings and enter the following data in the blue cells:

- Altitude
- Power
- Fuel Flow
- TAS

The spreadsheet will self populate the rest of the data and then taking a screen capture of the 8 separate tables - 4 range and endurance, 4 sample trip tables - is straighforward to include directly into your copy of the manual.

## Using the Weight & Balance Spreadsheet.

The goal of the Weight & Balance Spreadsheet is to generate Figure 6-8. Center of Gravity Moment Envelope graph.  4 points are required to create the graph.

The first point on the graph is the empty weight and CG of the plane.  Points 2 and 3 are at full up weight, 1550lbs, at most forward CG and most aft CG points.  The 4th point is the most aft CG with no pilot, passenger, fuel, and the most weight in the baggage area that remains within the aft CG limit. Connecting the 4 dots will create an envelope of acceptable CG and weight ranges for safe flight.

NOTE! The STi wing is 4.5" longer chord than the Super Sport wing and therefore has a different CG range: 10.33 - 17.4".
