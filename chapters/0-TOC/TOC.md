MANEUVERING LIMITS

This airplane is certificated in the utility category and is designed for limited aerobatic flight. In the
acquisition of various certificates such as commercial pilot, instrument pilot and flight instructor, certain
maneuvers are required. All of these maneuvers are permitted in this airplane.

No aerobatic maneuvers are approved except those listed below:

### MANEUVER MAXIMUM ENTRY SPEED*

```
Chandelles ................................................................................................................. 95 knots
Lazy Eights ................................................................................................................. 95 knots
Steep Turns ............................................................................................................... 95 knots
Spins ................................................................................................... Use Slow Deceleration
Stalls (Except Whip Stalls) .................................................................. Use Slow Deceleration
```
* Higher speeds can be used if abrupt use of the controls is avoided.

Aerobatics that may impose high loads should not be attempted. The important thing to bear in mind in
flight maneuvers is that the airplane is clean in aerodynamic design and will build up speed quickly with
the nose down. Proper speed control is an essential requirement for execution of any maneuver, and
care should always be exercised to avoid excessive speed which in turn can impose excessive loads. In
the execution of all maneuvers, avoid abrupt use of controls.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 2-7

loads.

KINDS OF OPERATION LIMITS

The airplane is equipped for day VFR and may be equipped for night VFR and/or IFR operations. FAR
Part 91 establishes the minimum required instrumentation and equipment for these operations. The
reference to types of flight operations on the operating limitations placard reflects equipment installed
at the time of Airworthiness Certificate issuance.

Flight into known icing conditions is prohibited.

INTRODUCTION

Section 3 provides checklist and amplified procedures for coping with emergencies that may occur.
Emergencies caused by airplane or engine malfunctions are extremely rare if proper preflight
inspections and maintenance are practiced. Enroute weather emergencies can be minimized or
eliminated by careful flight planning and good judgment when unexpected weather is encountered.
However, should an emergency arise, the basic guidelines described in this section should be considered
and applied as necessary to correct the problem. Emergency procedures associated with ELT and other
optional systems can be found in Section 9.

ICING

INADVERTENT ICING ENCOUNTER

1. Turn pitot heat switch ON (if installed).
2. Turn back or change altitude to obtain an outside air temperature that is less conducive to icing.
3. Pull cabin heat control full out to obtain maximum defroster air temperature. For greater air
    flow at reduced temperatures, adjust the cabin air control as required.
4. Open the throttle to increase engine speed and minimize ice build-up on propeller blades.
5. Watch for signs of carburetor air filter ice and apply carburetor heat as required. An unexpected
    loss in engine speed could be caused by carburetor ice or air intake filter ice. Lean the mixture
    for maximum RPM, if carburetor heat is used continuously.
6. Plan a landing at the nearest airport. With an extremely rapid ice build-up, select a suitable “off
    airport” landing site.
7. With an ice accumulation of 1/4 inch or more on the wing leading edges, be prepared for
    significantly higher stall speed.
8. Leave wing flaps retracted. With a severe ice build-up on the horizontal tail, the change in wing
    wake airflow direction caused by wing flap extension could result in a loss of elevator
    effectiveness.
9. Open left window and, if practical, scrape ice from a portion of the windshield for visibility in the
    landing approach.
10. Perform a landing approach using a forward slip, if necessary, for improved visibility.
11. Approach at 65 to 75 KIAS depending upon the amount of ice accumulation.
12. Perform a landing in level attitude.

LANDING WITH A FLAT MAIN TIRE

1. Wing Flaps – AS DESIRED.
2. Approach – NORMAL.
3. Touchdown – GOOD TIRE FIRST, hold airplane off flat tire as long as possible with aileron
    control.

AMPLIFIED PROCEDURES

ENGINE FAILURE

If an engine failure occurs during the takeoff run, the most important thing to do is stop the airplane on
the remaining runway. Those extra items on the checklist will provide added safety after a failure of this
type.

Prompt lowering of the nose to maintain airspeed and establish a glide attitude is the first response to
an engine failure after takeoff. In most cases, the landing should be planned straight ahead with only
small changes in direction to avoid obstructions. Altitude and airspeed are seldom sufficient to execute
a 180° gliding turn necessary to return to the runway. The checklist procedures assume that adequate
time exists to secure the fuel and ignition systems prior to touchdown.

After engine failure in flight, the best glide speed as shown in figure 3-1 should be established as quickly
as possible. While gliding toward a suitable landing area, an effort should be made to identify the cause
of the failure. If time permits, an engine restart should be attempted as shown in the checklist. If the
engine cannot be restarted, a forced landing without power must be completed.

FORCED LANDINGS

If all attempts to restart the engine fail and a forced landing is imminent, select a suitable field and
prepare for the landing as discussed under the Emergency Landing Without Engine Power checklist.

Before attempting an “off airport” landing with engine power available, one should fly over the landing
area at a safe but low altitude to inspect the terrain for obstructions and surface conditions, proceeding
as discussed under the Precautionary Landing With Engine Power checklist.

Prepare for ditching by securing or jettisoning heavy objects located in the baggage area and collect
folded coats for protection of occupants’ face at touchdown. Transmit Mayday message on 121.5 MHz
giving location and intentions.

LANDING WITHOUT ELEVATOR CONTROL

Trim for horizontal flight (with an airspeed of approximately 55 KIAS and flaps lowered to 20°) by using
throttle and elevator trim controls. Then **do not change the elevator trim control setting** ; control the
glide angle by adjusting power exclusively.

At flareout, the nose-down moment resulting from power reduction is an adverse factor and the
airplane may hit on the nose wheel. Consequently, at flareout, the trim control should be set at the full
nose-up position and the power adjusted so that the airplane will rotate to the horizontal attitude for
touchdown. Close the throttle at touchdown.

FIRES

Although engine fires are extremely rare in flight, the steps of the appropriate checklist should be
followed if one is encountered. After completion of this procedure, execute a forced landing. Do not
attempt to restart the engine.

The initial indication of an electrical fire is usually the odor of burning insulation. The checklist for this
problem should result in elimination of the fire.

EMERGENCY OPERATION IN CLOUDS

(Vacuum System Failure)

In the event of a vacuum system failure during flight in marginal weather, the directional indicator and
attitude indicator will be disabled, and the pilot will have to rely on the turn coordinator if he
inadvertently flies into clouds. The following instructions assume that only the electrically-powered turn
coordinator is operative, and that the pilot is not completely proficient in instrument flying.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 3-11

EXECUTING A 180° TURN IN CLOUDS

Upon inadvertently entering the clouds, an immediate plan should be made to turn back as follows:

1. Note the time of the minute hand and observe the position of the sweep second hand on the
    clock.
2. When the sweep second hand indicates the nearest half-minute, initiate a standard rate left
    turn, holding the turn coordinator symbolic airplane wing opposite the lower left index mark for
    60 seconds. Then roll back to level flight by leveling the miniature airplane.
3. Check accuracy of the turn by observing the compass heading which should be the reciprocal of
    the original heading.
4. If necessary, adjust heading primarily with skidding motions rather than rolling motions so that
    the compass will read more accurately.
5. Maintain altitude and airspeed by cautious application of elevator control. Avoid over
    controlling by keeping the hands off the control wheel as much as possible and steering only
    with rudder.

EMERGENCY DESCENT THROUGH CLOUDS

If conditions preclude reestablishment of VFR flight by a 180° turn, a descent through a cloud deck to
VFR conditions may be appropriate. If possible, obtain radio clearance for an emergency descent
through clouds. To guard against a spiral dive, choose an easterly or westerly heading to minimize
compass card swings due to changing bank angles. In addition, keep hands off the control wheel and
steer a straight course with rudder control by monitoring the turn coordinator. Occasionally check the
compass heading and make minor corrections to hold an approximate course. Before descending into
the clouds, set up a stabilized let-down condition as follows:

1. Apply full rich mixture.
2. Use full carburetor heat.
3. Reduce power to set up a 500 to 800 ft/min rate of descent.
4. Adjust the elevator trim for a stabilized descent at 70 KIAS.
5. Keep hands off control wheel.
6. Monitor turn coordinator and make corrections by rudder alone.
7. Check trend of compass card movement and make cautious corrections with rudder to stop
    turn.
8. Upon breaking out of clouds, resume normal cruising flight.

RECOVERY FROM A SPIRAL DIVE

If a spiral is encountered, proceed as follows:

1. Close the throttle.
2. Stop the turn by using coordinated aileron and rudder control to align the symbolic airplane in
    the turn coordinator with the horizon reference line.
3. Cautiously apply elevator back pressure to slowly reduce the airspeed to 70 KIAS.
4. Adjust the elevator trim control to maintain a 70 KIAS glide.
5. Keep hands off the control wheel, using rudder control to hold a straight heading.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 3-12

6. Apply carburetor heat.
7. Clear engine occasionally, but avoid using enough power to disturb the trimmed glide.
8. Upon breaking out of clouds, resume normal cruising flight.

FLIGHT IN ICING CONDITIONS

Flight into icing conditions is prohibited. An inadvertent encounter with these conditions can best be
handled using the checklist procedures. The best procedure, of course, is to turn back or change
altitude to escape icing conditions.

SPINS

Should an inadvertent spin occur, the following recovery procedure should be used:

### 1. PLACE AILERONS IN NEUTRAL POSITION.

### 2. RETARD THROTTLE TO IDLE POSITION.

### 3. APPLY AND HOLD FULL RUDDER OPPOSITE TO THE DIRECTION OF ROTATION.

### 4. JUST AFTER THE RUDDER REACHES THE STOP, MOVE THE CONTROL WHEEL BRISKLY FORWARD

```
FAR ENOUGH TO BREAK THE STALL. Full down elevator may be required at aft center of gravity
loadings to assure optimum recoveries.
```
5. **HOLD** THESE CONTROL INPUTS UNTIL ROTATION STOPS. Premature relaxation of the control
    inputs may extend the recovery.
6. AS ROTATION STOPS, NEUTRALIZE RUDDER, AND MAKE A SMOOTH RECOVERY FROM THE
    RESULTING DIVE.

### NOTE

```
If disorientation precludes a visual determination of the direction of
rotation, the symbolic airplane in the turn coordinator may be referred
to for this information.
```
For additional information on spins and spin recovery, see the discussion under SPINS in Normal
Procedures (Section 4).

ROUGH ENGINE OPERATION OR LOSS OF POWER

CARBURETOR ICING

A gradual loss of RPM and eventual engine roughness may result from the formation of carburetor ice.
To clear the ice, apply full throttle and pull the carburetor heat knob full out until the engine runs
smoothly; then remove carburetor heat and readjust the throttle. If conditions require the continued
use of carburetor heat in cruise flight, use the minimum amount of heat necessary to prevent ice from
forming and lean the mixture slightly for smoothest engine operation.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 3-13

SPARK PLUG FOULING

A slight engine roughness in flight may be caused by one or more spark plugs becoming fouled by
carbon or lead deposits. This may be verified by turning the ignition switch momentarily from BOTH to
either L or R position. An obvious power loss in single ignition operation is evidence of spark plug or
magneto trouble. Assuming that spark plugs are the more likely cause, lean the mixture to the
recommended lean setting for cruise flight. If the problem does not clear up in several minutes,
determine if a richer mixture setting will produce smoother operation. If not, proceed to the nearest
airport for repairs using the BOTH position of the ignition switch unless extreme roughness dictates the
use of a single ignition position.

MAGNETO MALFUNCTION

A sudden engine roughness or misfiring is usually evidence of magneto problems. Switching from BOTH
to either L or R ignition switch position will identify which magneto is malfunctioning. Select different
power settings and enrichen the mixture to determine if continued operation on BOTH magnetos is
practicable. If not, switch to the good magneto and proceed to the nearest airport for repairs.

LOW OIL PRESSURE

If low oil pressure is accompanied by normal oil temperature, there is a possibility the oil pressure gage
or relief valve is malfunctioning. A leak in the line to the gage is not necessarily cause for an immediate
precautionary landing because an orifice in this line will prevent a sudden loss of oil from the engine
sump. However, a landing at the nearest airport would be advisable to inspect the source of trouble.

If a total loss of oil pressure is accompanied by a rise in oil temperature, there is good reason to suspect
an engine failure is imminent. Reduce engine power immediately and select a suitable forced landing
field. Use only the minimum power required to reach the desired touchdown spot.

ELECTRICAL POWER SUPPLY SYSTEM MALFUNCTIONS

Malfunctions in the electrical power supply system can be detected by periodic monitoring of the
ammeter and over-voltage warning light; however, the cause of these malfunctions is usually difficult to
determine. A broken alternator drive belt or wiring is most likely the cause of alternator failures,
although other factors could cause the problem. A damaged or improperly adjusted voltage regulator
can also cause malfunctions. Problems of this nature constitute an electrical emergency and should be
dealt with immediately. Electrical power malfunctions usually fall into two categories: excessive rate of
charge and insufficient rate of charge. The paragraphs below describe the recommended remedy for
each situation.

EXCESSIVE RATE OF CHARGE

After engine starting and heavy electrical usage at low engine speeds (such as extended taxiing) the
battery condition will be low enough to accept above normal charging during the initial part of a flight.
However, after thirty minutes of cruising flight, the ammeter should be indicating less than two needle
widths of charging current. If the charging rate were to remain above this value on a long flight, the


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 3-14

battery would overheat and evaporate the electrolyte at an excessive rate. Electronic components in
the electrical system could be adversely affected by higher than normal voltage if a faulty voltage
regulator setting is causing the overcharging. To preclude these possibilities, an over-voltage sensor will
automatically shut down the alternator and the over-voltage warning light will illuminate if the charge
voltage reaches approximately 31.5 volts. Assuming that the malfunction was only momentary, an
attempt should be made to reactivate the alternator system. To do this, turn both sides of the master
switch off and then on again. If the problem no longer exists, normal alternator charging will resume
and the warning light will go off. If the light illuminates again, a malfunction is confirmed. In this event,
the flight should be terminated and/or the current drain on the battery minimized because the battery
can supply the electrical system for only a limited period of time. If the emergency occurs at night,
power must be conserved for later use of the landing light and flaps during landing.

INSUFFICIENT RATE OF CHARGE

If the ammeter indicates a continuous discharge rate in flight, the alternator is not supplying power to
the system and should be shut down since the alternator field circuit may be placing an unnecessary
load on the system. All nonessential equipment should be turned off and the flight terminated as soon
as practical.

AMPLIFIED PROCEDURES

STARTING ENGINE (Temperatures Above Freezing)

During engine starting, open the throttle approximately 1/2 inch. In warm weather, one stroke of the
primer should be sufficient. In temperatures near freezing, up to 3 strokes of the primer may be
necessary. As the engine starts, slowly adjust the throttle as required for 1000 RPM or less.

```
NOTE
The carburetor used on this airplane does not have an accelerator pump;
therefore, pumping of the throttle must be avoided during starting
because doing so will only cause excessive leaning.
```
Weak intermittent firing followed by puffs of black smoke from the exhaust stack indicates over priming
or flooding. Excess fuel can be cleared from the combustion chambers by the following procedure: set
the mixture control in the idle cut-off position, the throttle full open, and crank the engine through
several revolutions with the starter. Repeat the starting procedure without any additional priming.

If the engine is under primed (most likely in cold weather with a cold engine) it will not fire at all, and
additional priming will be necessary.

After starting, if the oil gage does not begin to show pressure within 30 seconds in the summertime and
about twice that long in very cold weather, stop the engine and investigate. Lack of oil pressure can
cause serious engine damage. After starting, avoid the use of carburetor heat unless icing conditions
prevail.

TAXIING

When taxiing, it is important that speed and use of brakes be held to a minimum and that all controls be
utilized (see Taxiing Diagram, figure 4.2) to maintain directional control and balance.

```
Figure 4-2. Taxiing Diagram
```
### NOTE

```
Strong quartering tail winds require caution. Avoid sudden bursts of the
throttle and sharp braking when the airplane is in this attitude. Use the
steerable nose wheel and rudder to maintain direction.
```
The carburetor heat control knob should be pushed full in during all ground operations unless heat is
absolutely necessary. When the knob is pulled out to the heat position, air entering the engine is not
filtered.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 4-13

Taxiing over loose gravel or cinders should be done at low engine speed to avoid abrasion and stone
damage to the propeller tips.

The nose wheel is designed to automatically center straight ahead when the nose strut is fully extended.
In the event the nose strut is over inflated and the airplane is loaded to a rearward center of gravity
position, it may be necessary to partially compress the strut to permit steering. This can be
accomplished prior to taxiing by depressing the airplane nose (by hand) or during taxi by sharply
applying brakes.

BEFORE TAKEOFF

WARM-UP

Most of the warm-up will have been conducted during taxi, and additional warm-up before takeoff
should be restricted to the checklist procedures. Since the engine is closely cowled for efficient in-flight
cooling, precautions should be taken to avoid overheating on the ground.

MAGNETO CHECK

The magneto check should be made at 1700 RPM as follows. Move ignition switch first to R position and
note RPM. Next move switch back to BOTH to clear the other set of plugs. Then move switch to the L
position, note RPM and return the switch to the BOTH position. RPM drop should not exceed 125 RPM
on either magneto or show greater than 50 RPM differential between magnetos. If there is a doubt
concerning operation of the ignition system, RPM checks at higher engine speeds will usually confirm
whether a deficiency exists.

An absence of RPM drop may be an indication of faulty grounding of one side of the ignition system or
should be cause for suspicion that the magneto timing is set in advance of the setting specified.

ALTERNATOR CHECK

Prior to flight where verification of proper alternator and voltage regulator operation is essential (such
as night or instrument flights), a positive verification can be made by loading the electrical system
momentarily (3 to 5 seconds) with the landing light, or by operating the wing flaps during the engine
run-up (1700 RPM). The ammeter will remain within a needle width of its initial position if the
alternator and voltage regulator are operating properly.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 4-14

TAKEOFF

POWER CHECK

It is important to check full-throttle engine operation early in the takeoff run. Any sign of rough engine
operation or sluggish engine acceleration is good cause for discontinuing the takeoff. If this occurs, you
are justified in making a thorough full-throttle static run-up before another takeoff is attempted. The
engine should run smoothly and turn approximately 2280 to 2380 RPM with carburetor heat off and
mixture leaned to maximum RPM.

Full throttle run-ups over loose gravel are especially harmful to propeller tips. When takeoffs must be
made over a gravel surface, it is very important that the throttle be advanced slowly. This allows the
airplane to start rolling before high RPM is developed, and the gravel will be blown back of the propeller
rather than pulled into it. When unavoidable small dents appear in the propeller blades, they should be
immediately corrected as described in Section 8 under Propeller Care.

Prior to takeoff from fields above 3000 feet elevation, the mixture should be leaned to give maximum
RPM in a full-throttle, static run-up.

After full throttle is applied, adjust the throttle friction lock clockwise to prevent the throttle from
creeping back from a maximum power position. Similar friction lock adjustment should be made as
required in other flight conditions to maintain a fixed throttle setting.

WING FLAP SETTING

Normal takeoffs are accomplished with wing flaps 0° - 10°. Using 10° wing flaps reduces the total
distance over an obstacle by approximately 10%. Flap deflections greater than 10° are not approved for
takeoff. If 10° wing flaps are used for takeoff, they should be left down until all obstacles are cleared
and a safe flap retraction speed of 60 KIAS is reached.

On a short field, 10° wing flaps and an obstacle clearance speed of 54 KIAS should be used. This speed
provides the best overall climb speed to clear obstacles when taking into account turbulence often
found near ground level.

Soft or rough field takeoffs are performed with 10° wing flaps by lifting the airplane off the ground as
soon as practical in a slightly tail-low attitude. If no obstacles are ahead, the airplane should be leveled
off immediately to accelerate to a higher climb speed.

Takeoffs into strong crosswinds normally are performed with the minimum flap setting necessary for the
field length, to minimize the drift angle immediately after takeoff. The airplane is accelerated to a speed
slightly higher than normal, then pulled off abruptly to prevent possible settling back to the runway
while drifting. When clear of the ground, make a coordinated turn into the wind to correct for drift.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 4-15

ENROUTE CLIMB

Normal climbs are performed with flaps up and full throttle and at speeds 5 to 10 knots higher than best
rate-of-climb speeds for the best combination of performance, visibility and engine cooling. The mixture
should be full rich below 3000 feet and may be leaned above 3000 feet for smoother operation or to
obtain maximum RPM. For maximum rate of climb, use the best rate-of-climb speeds shown in the Rate
Of Climb chart in Section 5. If an obstruction dictates the use of a steep climb angle, the best angle-of-
climb speed should be used with flaps up and maximum power. Climbs at speeds lower than the best
angle-of-climb speed should be of short duration to improve engine cooling.

CRUISE

Normal cruising is performed between 55% and 75% power. The engine RPM and corresponding fuel
consumption for various altitudes can be determined by using your Kitfox Power Computer or the data
in Section 5.

### NOTE

```
Cruising should be done at 65% to 75% power until a total of 50 hours has
accumulated or oil consumption has stabilized. This is to ensure proper
seating of the rings and is applicable to new engines, and engines in
service following cylinder replacement or top overhaul of one or more
cylinders.
```
The data in Section 5 shows the increased range and improved fuel economy that is obtainable when
operating at lower power settings. The use of lower power settings and the selection of cruise altitude
on the basis of the most favorable wind conditions are significant factors that should be considered on
every trip to reduce fuel consumption.

The Cruise Performance Table, figure 4-3, shows the true airspeed and nautical mile per gallon during
cruise for various altitudes and percent powers. This table should be used as a guide, along with the
available winds aloft information, to determine the most favorable altitude and power setting for a
given trip.

To achieve the recommended lean mixture fuel consumption figures shown in Section 5, the mixture
should be leaned until engine RPM peaks and drops 25-50 RPM. At lower powers it may be necessary to
enrichen the mixture slightly to obtain smooth operation.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 4-16

Carburetor ice, as evidenced by an unexplained drop in RPM, can be removed by application of full
carburetor heat. Upon regaining the original RPM (with heat off), use the minimum amount of heat (by
trial and error) to prevent ice from forming. Since the heated air causes a richer mixture, readjust the
mixture setting when carburetor heat is to be used continuously in cruise flight.

The use of full carburetor heat is recommended during flight in very heavy rain to avoid the possibility of
engine stoppage due to excessive water ingestion. The mixture setting should be readjusted for
smoothest operation.

FUEL SAVINGS PROCEDURES FOR FLIGHT TRAINING OPERATIONS

For best fuel economy during flight training operations, the following procedures are recommended.

1. Use 55% to 60% power while transitioning to and from the practice area (approximately 2200-
    2250 RPM).
2. Lean the mixture for maximum RPM during climbs above 3000 feet. The mixture may be left
    leaned for practicing such maneuvers as stalls.
3. Lean the mixture for maximum RPM during all operations at any altitude, including those below
    3000 feet, when using 75% or less power.

### NOTE

```
When cruising at 75% or less power, the mixture may be further leaned
until the RPM peaks and drops 25-50 RPM. This is especially applicable
to cross-country training flights, but may also be practiced during
transition flights to and from the practice area.
```
Using the above recommended procedures can provide fuel savings of up to 13% when compared to
typical training operations at a full rich mixture.

STALLS

The stall characteristics are conventional for the flaps up and flaps down condition. The stall warning
horn produces a steady signal 5 to 10 knots before the actual stall is reached and remains on until the
airplane flight attitude is changed. Stall speeds for various combinations of flap setting and bank angle
are summarized in Section 5.

SPINS

Intentional spins are approved in this airplane (see Section 2). Before attempting to perform spins,
however, several items should be carefully considered to assure a safe flight. No spins should be
attempted without first having received dual instruction in both spin entries and spin recoveries from a
qualified instructor who is familiar with the spin characteristics of the Kitfox 152.

The cabin should be clean and all loose equipment (including the microphone) should be stowed. For a
solo flight in which spins will be conducted, the copilot’s seat belt and shoulder harness should be
secured. **Spins with baggage loadings or occupied child’s seat are not approved.**


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 4-17

The seat belts and shoulder harnesses should be adjusted to provide proper restraint during all
anticipated flight conditions. However, care should be taken to ensure that the pilot can easily reach
the flight controls and produce maximum control travel.

It is recommended that, where feasible, entries be accomplished at high enough altitude that recoveries
are completed 4000 feet or more above ground level. At least 1000 feet of altitude loss should be
allowed for a 1-turn spin and recovery, while a 6-turn spin and recovery may require somewhat more
than twice that amount. For example, the recommended entry altitude for a 6-turn spin would be 6000
feet above ground level. In any case, entries should be planned so that recoveries are completed **well
above** the minimum 1500 feet above ground level required by FAR 91.71. Another reason for using high
altitudes for practicing spins is that a greater field of view is provided which will assist in maintaining
pilot orientation.

The normal entry is made from a power-off stall. As the stall is approached, the elevator control should
be smoothly pulled to the full aft position. Just prior to reaching the stall “break”, rudder control in the
desired direction of the spin rotation should be applied so that full rudder deflection is reached almost
simultaneously with reaching full aft elevator. A slightly greater rate of deceleration than for normal
stall entries or the use of partial power at the entry will assure more consistent and positive entries to
the spin. Both elevator and rudder controls should be held full with the spin until the spin recovery is
initiated. An inadvertent relaxation of either of these controls could result in the development of a
nose-down spiral.

### NOTE

```
Careful attention should be taken to assure that the aileron control is
neutral during all phases of the spin since any aileron deflection in the
direction of the spin may alter the spin characteristics by increasing the
rotation rate and changing the pitch attitude.
```
For the purpose of training in spins and spin recoveries, a 1 to 2 turn spin is adequate and should be
used. Up to 2 turns, the spin will progress to a fairly rapid rate of rotation and a steep attitude.
Application of recovery controls will produce prompt recoveries of from 1/4 to 1/2 of a turn.

If the spin is continued beyond the 2 to 3-turn range, some change in character of the spin may be
noted. Rotation rates may vary and some additional sideslip may be felt. Normal recoveries from such
extended spins may take up to a full turn or more.

Regardless of how many turns the spin is held or how it is entered, the following recovery technique
should be used:

### 1. VERIFY THAT AILERONS ARE NEUTRAL AND THROTTLE IS IN IDLE POSITION.

### 2. APPLY AND HOLD FULL RUDDER OPPOSITE TO THE DIRECTION OF ROTATION.

### 3. JUST AFTER THE RUDDER REACHES THE STOP, MOVE THE CONTROL WHEEL BRISKLY FORWARD

```
FAR ENOUGH TO BREAK THE STALL. Full down elevator may be required at aft enter of gravity
loadings to assure optimum recoveries.
```
4. **HOLD** THESE CONTROL INPUTS UNTIL ROTATION STOPS. Premature relaxation of the control
    inputs may extend the recovery.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 4-18

### 5. AS ROTATION STOPS, NEUTRALIZE RUDDER, AND MAKE A SMOOTH RECOVERY FROM THE

### RESULTING DIVE.

### NOTE

```
If disorientation precludes a visual determination of the direction of
rotation, the symbolic airplane in the turn coordinator may be referred
to for this information.
```
Variations in basic airplane rigging or in weight and balance due to installed equipment or cockpit
occupancy can cause differences in behavior, particularly in extended spins. These differences are
normal and will result in variations in the spin characteristics and in the recovery procedure should
always be used and will result in the most expeditious recovery from any spin.

Intentional spins with flaps extended are prohibited, since the high speed which may occur during
recovery are potentially damaging to the flap/wing structure.

LANDING

Normal landing approaches can be made with power-on or power-off at speeds of 60 to 70 KIAS with
flaps up, and 55 to 65 KIAS with flaps down. Surface winds and air turbulence are usually the primary
factors in determining the most comfortable approach speeds.

Actual touchdown should be made with power-off and on the main wheels first. The nose wheel should
be lowered smoothly to the runway as speed is diminished.

SHORT FIELD LANDING

For a short field landing in smooth air conditions, make an approach at 54 KIAS with 30° flaps using
enough power to control the glide path. After all approach obstacles are cleared, progressively reduce
power and maintain 54 KIAS by lowering the nose of the airplane. Touchdown should be made with
power-off and on the main wheels first. Immediately after touchdown, lower the nose wheel and apply
heavy braking as required. For maximum brake effectiveness, retract flaps, hold full nose-up elevator,
and apply maximum brake pressure without sliding the tires.

Slightly higher approach speeds should be used under turbulent air conditions.

CROSSWIND LANDING

When landing in a strong crosswind, use the minimum flap setting required for the field length. Use a
wing low, crab, or a combination method of drift correction and land in a nearly level attitude.

BALKED LANDING

In a balked landing (go-around) climb, the wing flap setting should be reduced to 20° immediately after
full power is applied. Upon reaching a safe airspeed, the flaps should be slowly retracted to the full up
position.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 4-19

COLD WEATHER OPERATION

Prior to starting with temperatures below freezing, it is advisable to pull the propeller through several
times by hand to “break loose” or “limber” the oil, thus conserving battery energy.

### NOTE

```
When pulling the propeller through by hand, treat it as if the ignition
switch is turned on. A loose or broken ground wire on either magneto
could cause the engine to fire.
```
Preheat is generally required with outside air temperatures below -18°C (0°F) and is recommended
when temperatures are below -7° (20°F).

Cold weather starting procedures are as follows:

**With Preheat:**

1. Ignition Switch – OFF.
2. Throttle – CLOSED.
3. Mixtures – IDLE CUT-OFF.
4. Parking Brake – SET.
5. Propeller – PULL through by hand several revolutions.

### NOTE

```
Caution should be used to ensure the brakes are set or a qualified person
is at the controls.
```
6. Mixture – RICH.
7. Throttle – OPEN 1/2 to 3/4 INCH.
8. Prime – 2 to 4 STROKES depending on temperature.
9. Primer – RECHARGE for priming after engine start.
10. Propeller Area – CLEAR.
11. Master Switch – ON.
12. Ignition Switch – START (release when engine starts).
13. Prime – AS REQUIRED until the engine runs smoothly.
14. Throttle – ADJUST for 1200 to 1500 RPM for approximately one minute after which the RPM can
    be lowered to 1000 or less.
15. Oil Pressure – CHECK.
16. Primer – LOCK.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 4-20

**Without Preheat:**

The procedure for starting without preheat is the same as with preheat except the engine should be
primed an additional three strokes just prior to pulling the propeller through by hand.

### NOTE

```
If the engine fires but does not start or continue running, repeat the
above starting procedure beginning with step 6. If the engine does not
start during the first few attempts, or if engine firing diminishes in
strength, it is possible that the spark plugs have been frosted over, in
which case preheat must be used before another start is attempted.
```
During cold weather operations, no indication will be apparent on the oil temperature gage prior to
takeoff if outside air temperatures are very cold. After a suitable warm-up period (2 to 5 minutes at
1000 RPM), accelerate the engine several times to higher engine RPM. If the engine accelerates
smoothly and oil pressure remains normal and steady, the airplane is ready for takeoff.

When operating in temperatures below -18°C, avoid using partial carburetor heat. Partial heat may
increase the carburetor air temperature to the 0° to 21°C range, where icing is critical under certain
atmospheric conditions.

NOISE ABATEMENT

Increased emphasis on improving the quality of our environment requires renewed effort on the part of
all pilots to minimize the effect of airplane noise on the public.

We, as pilots, can demonstrate our concern for environmental improvement, by application of the
following suggested procedures, and thereby tend to build public support for aviation:

1. Pilots operating aircraft under VFR over outdoor assemblies of persons, recreational and park
    areas, and other noise-sensitive areas should make every effort to fly not less than 2000 feet
    above the surface, weather permitting, even though flight at a lower level may be consistent
    with the provisions of government regulations.
2. During departure from or approach to an airport, climb after takeoff and descent for landing
    should be made so as to avoid prolonged flight at low altitude near noise-sensitive areas.

### NOTE

```
The above recommended procedures do not apply where they would
conflict with Air Traffic Control clearances or instructions, or where, in
the pilot’s judgment, an altitude of less than 2000 feet is necessary for
him to adequately exercise his duty to see and avoid other aircraft.
```
The certificated noise level for the Model 152 at 1670 pounds maximum weight is 65.0 dB(A). No
determination has been made by the Federal Aviation Administration that the noise levels of this
airplane are or should be acceptable or unacceptable for operation at, into or out of, any airport.

INTRODUCTION

Performance data charts on the following pages are presented so that you may know what to expect
from the airplane under various conditions, and also, to facilitate the planning of flights in detail and
with reasonable accuracy. The data in the charts has been computed from actual flight tests with the
airplane and engine in good condition and using average piloting techniques.

It should be noted that the performance information presented in the range and endurance profile
charts allows for 45 minutes reserve fuel based on 45% power. Fuel flow data for cruise is based on the
recommended lean mixture setting. Some indeterminate variables such as mixture leaning technique,
fuel metering characteristics, engine and propeller condition, and air turbulence may account for
variations of 10% or more in range and endurance. Therefore, it is important to utilize all available
information to estimate the fuel required for the particular flight.

USE OF PERFORMANCE CHARTS

Performance data is presented in tabular or graphical form to illustrate the effect of different variables.
Sufficiently detailed information is provided in the tables so that conservative values can be selected
and used to determine the particular performance figure with reasonable accuracy.

SAMPLE PROBLEM

The following sample flight problem utilizes information from the various charts to determine the
predicted performance data for a typical flight. The following information is known:

AIRPLANE CONFIGURATION
Takeoff weight 1610 Pounds
Usable fuel 24.5 Gallons

### TAKEOFF CONDITIONS

Field pressure altitude 1500 Feet
Temperature 28°C (16°C above standard)
Wind component along runway 12 Knot Headwind
Field length 3500 Feet

### CRUISE CONDITIONS

Total distance 320 Nautical Miles
Pressure altitude 5500 Feet
Temperature 20°C (16°C above standard)
Expected wind enroute 10 Knot Headwind

### LANDING CONDITIONS

Field pressure altitude 2000 Feet
Temperature 25°C
Field length 3000 Feet


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 5-4

TAKEOFF

The takeoff distance chart, figure 5-4, should be consulted, keeping in mind that the distances shown
are based on the short field technique. Conservative distances can be established by reading the chart
at the next higher value of altitude and temperature. For example, in this particular sample problem,
the takeoff distance information presented for a pressure altitude of 2000 feet and a temperature of
30°C should be used and results in the following:

Ground roll 980 Feet
Total distance to clear a 50-foot obstacle 1820 Feet

These distances are well within the available takeoff field length. However, a correction for the effect of
wind may be made based on Note 3 of the takeoff chart. The correction for a 12 knot headwind is:

(^129) 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾 × 10%=13% 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷
This results in the following distances, corrected for wind:
Ground roll, zero wind 980
Decrease in ground roll (980 feet × 13%) 127
Corrected ground roll 853 Feet
Total distance to clear a 50-foot obstacle, zero wind: 1820
Decrease in total distance (1820 feet × 13%) 237
Corrected total distance to clear 50-foot obstacle 1583 Feet
CRUISE
The cruising altitude should be selected based on a consideration of trip length, winds aloft, and the
airplane’s performance. A typical cruising altitude and the expected wind enroute have been given for
this sample problem. However, the power setting selection for cruise must be determined based on
several considerations. These include the cruise performance characteristics presented in figure 5-7, the
range profile chart presented in figure 5-8, and the endurance profile chart presented in figure 5-9.
The relationship between power and range is illustrated by the range profile chart. Considerable fuel
savings and longer range result when lower power settings are used.
The range profile chart indicates that use of 65% power at 5500 feet yields a predicted range of 375
nautical miles under no wind conditions. The endurance profile chart, figure 5-9, shows a corresponding
3.9 hours.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 5-5

The range figure of 375 nautical miles is corrected to account for the expected 10 knot headwind at
5500 feet.

Range, zero wind 375
Decrease in range due to wind (3.9 hours × 10 knot headwind) 39
Corrected range 336 Nautical Miles

This indicates that the trip can be made without a fuel stop using approximately 65% power.

The cruise performance chart, figure 5-7, is entered at 6000 feet altitude and 20°C above standard
temperature. These values most nearly correspond to the planned altitude and expected temperature
conditions. The engine speed chosen is 2400 RPM, which results in the following:

Power 64%
True airspeed 99 Knots
Cruise fuel flow 5.2 GPH

The power computer may be used to determine power and fuel consumption more accurately during
the flight.

FUEL REQUIRED

The total fuel required for the flight may be estimated using the performance information in figures 5-6
and 5-7. For this sample problem, figure 5-6 shows that a climb from 2000 feet to 6000 feet requires 1
gallon of fuel. The corresponding distance during the climb is 9 nautical miles. These values are for a
standard temperature (as shown on the climb chart) and are sufficiently accurate for most flight
planning purposes. However, a further correction for the effect of temperature may be made as noted
on the climb chart. The approximate effect of a non-standard temperature is to increase the time, fuel
and distance by 10% for each 10°C above standard temperature, due to the lower rate of climb. In this
case, assuming a temperature 16°C above standard, the correction would be:

### 16°𝐶𝐶10°𝐶𝐶 ×10%=16% 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷

With this factor included, the fuel estimate would be calculated as follows:

Fuel to climb, standard temperature 1.0
Increase due to non-standard temperature (1.0 × 16%) 0.2

Corrected fuel to climb 1.2 Gallons

Using a similar procedure for the distance to climb results in 10 nautical miles.

The resultant cruise distance is:

Total distance 320
Climb distance -10

Cruise distance 310 Nautical Miles


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 5-6

With an expected 10 knot headwind, the ground speed for cruise is predicted to be:

### 99

### -10

89 Knots

Therefore, the time required for the cruise portion of the trip is:

### 310 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝐾𝐾𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 89 𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾𝐾^ 𝑀𝑀𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 𝑀𝑀𝐾𝐾=3.5 ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷

The fuel required for cruise is:

3.5 Hours × 5.2 gallons/hour = 18.2 Gallons

The total estimated fuel required is as follows:

Engine start, taxi, and takeoff 0.8
Climb 1.2
Cruise 18.2

Total fuel required 20.2 Gallons

This will leave a fuel reserve of:

### 24.5

### -20.2

4.3 Gallons

Once the flight is underway, ground speed checks will provide a more accurate basis for estimating the
time enroute and the corresponding fuel required to complete the trip with ample reserve.

LANDING

A procedure similar to takeoff should be used for estimating the landing distance at the destination
airport. Figure 5-10 presents landing distances for various airport altitude and temperature
combinations using the short field technique. The distances corresponding to 2000 feet and 30°C are as
follows:

Ground roll 535 Feet
Total distance to clear a 50-foot obstacle 1300 Feet

A correction for the effect of wind may be made based on Note 2 of the landing chart using the same
procedure as outlined for takeoff.

INTRODUCTION

This section describes the procedure for establishing the basic empty weight and moment of the
airplane. Sample forms are provided for reference. Procedures for calculating the weight and moment
for various operations are also provided. A comprehensive list of all Kitfox equipment available for this
airplane is included at the back of this section.

It should be noted that specific information regarding the weight, arm, moment and installed equipment
list for this airplane can only be found in the appropriate weight and balance records carried in the
airplane.

AIRPLANE WEIGHING PROCEDURES

1. Preparation
    a. Inflate tires to recommended operating pressures.
    b. Remove the fuel tank sump quick-drain fittings and fuel line drain plug to drain all fuel.
    c. Remove oil sump drain plug to drain all oil.
    d. Move sliding seats to the most forward position.
    e. Raise flaps to the fully retracted position.
    f. Place all control surfaces in neutral position.
2. Leveling
    a. Place scales under each wheel (500# minimum capacity for scales).
    b. Deflate nose tire and/or lower or raise the nose strut to center bubble on level (see figure 6-
       1).
3. Weighing
    a. With the airplane level and brakes released, record the weight shown on each scale. Deduct
       the tare, if any, from each reading.
4. Measuring
    a. Obtain measurement A by measuring horizontally (along the airplane center line) from a line
       stretched between the main wheel centers to a plumb bob dropped from the firewall.
    b. Obtain measurement B by measuring horizontally and parallel to the airplane center line,
       from center of nose wheel axle, left side, to a plumb bob dropped from the line between the
       main wheel centers. Repeat on right side and average the measurements.
5. Using weights from item 3 and measurements from item 4, the airplane weight and C.G. can be
    determined.
6. Basic Empty Weight may be determined by completing figure 6-1.

WEIGHT AND BALANCE

The following information will enable you to operate your Kitfox within the prescribed weight and
center of gravity limitations. To figure weight and balance, use the Sample Problem, Loading Graph, and
Center of Gravity Moment Envelope as follows:

Take the basic empty weight and moment from appropriate weight and balance records carried in your
airplane, and enter them in the column titled YOUR AIRPLANE on the Sample Loading Problem.

### NOTE

```
In addition to the basic empty weight and moment noted on these
records, the C.G. arm (fuselage station) is also shown, but need not be
used on the Sample Loading Problem. The moment which is shown
must be divided by 1000 and this value used as the moment/1000 on
the loading problem.
```
Use the Loading Graph to determine the moment/1000 for each additional item to be carried; then list
these on the loading problem.

### NOTE

```
Loading Graph information for the pilot, passengers and baggage is
based on seats positioned for average occupants and baggage loaded in
the center of the baggage areas as shown on the Loading Arrangements
diagram. For loadings which may differ from these, the Sample Loading
Problem lists fuselage stations for these items to indicate their forward
and aft C.G. range limitation (seat travel and baggage area limitation).
Additional moment calculations, based on the actual weight and C.G.
arm (fuselage station) of the item being loaded, must be made if the
position of the load is different from that shown on the Loading Graph.
```
Total the weights and moments/1000 and plot these values on the Center of Gravity Moment Envelope
to determine whether the point falls within the envelope, and if the loading is acceptable.

EQUIPMENT LIST

The following equipment list is a comprehensive list of all Kitfox equipment available for this airplane.
A separate equipment list of items installed in your specific airplane is provided in your aircraft file. The
following list and the specific list for your airplane have a similar order of listing.

This equipment list provides the following information:

An **item number** gives the identification number for the item. Each number is prefixed with a letter
which identifies the **descriptive** grouping (example: A. Powerplant & Accessories) under which it is
listed. Suffix leters identify the equipment as a required item, a standard item or an optional item.
Suffix letters are as follows:
-R = required items of equipment for FAA certification
-S = standard equipment items
-O = optional equipment items replacing required or standard items
-A = optional equipment items which are in addition to required or standard items

A **reference drawing** column provides the drawing number for the item.

### NOTE

```
If additional equipment is to be installed, it must be done in accordance
with the reference drawing, accessory kit instructions, or a separate FAA
approval.
```
Columns showing **weight (in pounds)** and **arm (in inches)** provide the weight and center of gravity
location for the equipment.

### NOTE

```
Unless otherwise indicated, true values (not net change values) for the
weight and arm are shown. Positive arms are distances aft of the
airplane datum; negative arms are distances forward of the datum.
```
### NOTE

```
Asterisks (*) after the item weight and arm indicate complete assembly
installations. Some major components of the assembly are listed on the
lines immediately following. The summation of these major
components does not necessarily equal the complete assembly
installation.

INTRODUCTION

This section provides description and operation of the airplane and its systems. Some equipment
described herein is optional and may not be installed in the airplane. Refer to Section 9, Supplements,
for details of other optional systems and equipment.

AIRFRAME

The airplane is an all-metal, two-place, high-wing, single-engine airplane equipped with tricycle landing
gear, and is designed for general utility purposes.

The construction of the fuselage is a conventional formed sheet metal bulkhead, stringer, and skin
design referred to as semimonocoque. Major items of structure are the front and rear carry-through
spars to which the wings are attached, a bulkhead and forgings for main landing gear attachment at the
base of the rear door posts, and a bulkhead with attaching plates at the base of the forward door posts
for the lower attachment of the wing struts. Four engine mount stringers are also attached to the
forward door posts and extend forward to the firewall.

The externally braced wings, containing the fuel tanks, are constructed of a front and rear spar with
formed sheet metal ribs, doublers, and stringers. The entire structure is covered with aluminum skin.
The front spars are equipped with wing-to-fuselage and wing-to-strut attach fittings. The aft spars are
equipped with wing-to-fuselage attach fittings, and are partial-span spars. Conventional hinged ailerons
and single-slotted flaps are attached to the trailing edge of the wings. The ailerons are constructed of a
forward spar containing balance weights, formed sheet metal ribs and “V” type corrugated aluminum
skin joined together at the trailing edge. The flaps are constructed basically the same as the ailerons,
with the exception of the balance weights and the addition of a formed sheet metal leading edge

## SECTION

The empennage (tail assembly) consists of a conventional vertical stabilizer, rudder, horizontal stabilizer,
and elevator. The vertical stabilizer consists of a spar, formed sheet metal ribs and reinforcements, a
wrap-around skin panel, formed leading edge skin and a dorsal. The rudder is constructed of a formed
leading edge skin containing hinge halves, a wrap-around skin panel and ribs, and a formed trailing edge
skin with a ground adjustable trim tab at its base. The top of the rudder incorporates a leading edge
extension which contains a balance weight. The horizontal stabilizer is constructed of a forward spar,
main spar, formed sheet metal ribs and stiffeners, a wrap-around skin panel, and formed leading edge
skins. The horizontal stabilizer also contains the elevator trim tab actuator. Construction of the elevator
consists of a main spark and bellcrank, left and right wrap-around skin panels, and a formed trailing
edge skin on the left half of the elevator; the entire trailing edge of the right half is hinged and forms the
elevator trim tab. The leading edge of both left and right elevator tips incorporate extensions which
contain balance weights.

FLIGHT CONTROLS

The airplane’s flight control system (see figure 7-1) consists of conventional aileron, rudder, and elevator
control surfaces. The control surfaces are manually operated through mechanical linkage using a
control wheel for the ailerons and elevator, and rudder/brake pedals for the rudder.

Extensions are available for the rudder/brake pedals. They consist of a rudder pedal face, two spacers
and two spring clips. To install an extension, place the clip on the bottom of the extension under the
bottom of the rudder pedal and snap the top clip over the top of the rudder pedal. Check that the
extension is firmly in place. To remove the extensions, reverse the above procedures.

TRIM SYSTEM

A manually-operated elevator trim tab is provided. Elevator trimming is accomplished through the
elevator trim tab by utilizing the vertically mounted trim control wheel. Forward rotation of the trim
wheel will trim nose-down; conversely, aft rotation will trim nose-up.

INSTRUMENT PANEL

The instrument panel (see figure 7-2) is designed to place the primary flight instruments directly in front
of the pilot. The gyro-operated flight instruments are arranged one above the other, slightly to the left
of the control column. To the left of these instruments are the airspeed indicator, turn coordinator, and
suction gage. The clock, altimeter, rate-of-climb indicator, and navigation instruments are above and/or
to the right of the control column. Avionics equipment is stacked approximately on the centerline of the
panel, with space for additional equipment on the lower right side of the instrument panel. The right
side of the panel also contains the tachometer, ammeter, over-voltage light, and additional instruments
such as a flight hour recorder. A subpanel, under the primary instrument panel, contains the fuel
quantity indicators, cigar lighter, and engine instruments positioned below the pilot’s control wheel.
The electrical switches, panel and radio light rheostat knob, ignition and master switches, primer, and
parking brake control are located around these instruments. The engine controls, wing flap switch, and
cabin air and heat control knobs are to the right of the pilot, along the upper edge of the subpanel.
Directly below these controls are the elevator trim control wheel, trim position indicator, microphone,
and circuit breakers. A map compartment is on the extreme right side of the subpanel.

For details concerning the instruments, switches, circuit breakers, and controls on this panel, refer in
this section to the description of the systems to which these items are related.

GROUND CONTROL

Effective ground control while taxiing is accomplished through nose wheel steering by using the rudder
pedals; left rudder pedal to steer left and right rudder pedal to steer right. When a rudder pedal is
depressed, a spring-loaded steering bungee (which is connected to the nose gear and to the rudder
bars) will turn the nose wheel through an arc of approximately 8.5° each side of center. By applying
either left or right brake, the degree of turn may be increased by up to 30° each side of center.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 7-9

Moving the airplane by hand is most easily accomplished by attaching a tow bar to the nose gear strut.
If a tow bar is not available, or pushing is required, use the wing struts as push points. Do not use the
vertical or horizontal surfaces to move the airplane. If the airplane is to be towed by vehicle, never turn
the nose wheel more than 30° either side of center or structural damage to the nose gear could result.

The minimum turning radius of the airplane, using differential braking and nose wheel steering during
taxi, is approximately 24 feet 8 inches. To obtain a minimum radius turn during ground handling, the
airplane may be rotated around either main landing gear by pressing down on the tailcone just forward
of the vertical stabilizer to raise the nose wheel off the ground.

WING FLAP SYSTEM

The wing flaps are of the single-slot type (see figure 7-3), and are extended or retracted by positioning
the wing flap switch lever on the instrument panel to the desired flap deflection position. The switch
lever is moved up or down in a slot in the instrument panel that provides mechanical stops at the 10°
and 20° positions. For flap settings greater than 10°, move the switch lever to the right to clear the stop
and position it as desired. A scale and pointer on the left side of the switch lever indicates flap travel in
degrees. The wing flap system circuit is protected by a 15-ampere circuit breaker, labeled FLAP, on the
right side of the instrument panel.

```
Figure 7-3. Wing Flap System
```

### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 7-10

LANDING GEAR SYSTEM

The landing gear is of the tricycle type with a steerable nose wheel and two main wheels. The landing
gear may be equipped with wheel fairings. Shock absorption is provided by the tubular spring-steel
main landing gear struts and the air/oil nose gear shock strut. Each main gear wheel is equipped with a
hydraulically actuated disc-type brake on the inboard side of each wheel. When wheel fairings are
installed an aerodynamic fairing covers each brake.

BAGGAGE COMPARTMENT

The baggage compartment consists of the area from the back of the pilot and passenger’s seats to the
aft cabin bulkhead. Access to the baggage compartment is gained from within the airplane cabin. A
baggage net with six tie-down straps is provided for securing baggage and is attached by tying the straps
to tie-down rings provided in the airplane. When loading the airplane, children should not be placed or
permitted in the baggage compartment, unless a child’s seat is installed, and any material that might be
hazardous to the airplane or occupants should not be placed anywhere in the airplane. For baggage
area dimensions, refer to Section 6.

SEATS

The seats arrangement consists of two separate adjustable seats for the pilot and passenger and, if
installed, a child’s seat in the rear cabin area. The pilot’s and passenger’s seats are available in two
designs: four-way and six-way adjustable.

Four-way seats may be moved forward or aft, and the seat back angle changed. To position either seat,
lift the lever under the inboard corner of the seat, slide the seat into position, release the lever, and
check that the seat is locked in place. To adjust the seat back, pull forward on the knob under the
center of the seat and apply pressure to the back. To return the seat back to the upright position, pull
forward on the exposed portion of the seat back frame. Both seat backs will also fold full forward.

The six-way seats may be moved forward or aft, adjusted for height, and the seat back angle changed.
Position either seat by lifting the tubular handle under the inboard front corner of the seat bottom and
slide the seat to the desired position. Release the lever and check that the seat is locked in place. The
seats may be raised or lowered two inches, in one inch steps, and should be adjusted prior to flight. To
raise or lower either seat, pull forward on a “T” handle under the seat near the inboard corner, force the
seat down against spring tension or allow spring tension to raise it to the desired position, release the
“T” handle, and then allow the seat to move until it locks in place. Seat back angle is adjustable by
rotating a lever on the ear inboard corner of each seat. To adjust either seat back, rotate the lever aft
and apply pressure against the back until it stops moving; then release the lever. The seat back may be
returned to the upright position by pulling forward on the exposed portion of the lower seat back frame.
Check that the release lever has returned to its vertical position. Both seat backs will fold full forward.

A child’s seat is available for installation in the rear of the cabin. The seat back is secured to the cabin
sidewalls, and the seat bottom is attached to brackets on the floor. This seat is non-adjustable.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 7-11

SEAT BELT AND SHOULDER HARNESSES

All seat positions are equipped with seat belts (see figure 7-4). The pilot’s and passenger’s seats are also
equipped with separate shoulder harnesses. Integrated seat belt/shoulder harnesses with inertia reels
can be furnished for the pilot’s and passenger’s seat positions if desired.

SEAT BELTS

The seat belts used with the pilot’s seat, passenger’s seat, and the child’s seat (if installed) are attached
to fittings on the floorboard. The buckle half of the seat belt is inboard of each seat and has a fixed
length; the link half of the belt is outboard and is the adjustable part of the belt.

To use the seat belts for the pilot’s and passenger’s seats, position the seat as desired, and then
lengthen the link half of the belt as needed by grasping the sides of the link and pulling against the belt.
Insert and lock the belt link into the buckle. Tighten the belt to a snug fit by pulling the free end of the
belt. The seat belt for the child’s seat (if installed) is used in the same manner as the belts for the pilot’s
and passenger’s seats. To release these seat belts, grasp the top of the buckle opposite the link and pull
upward.

SHOULDER HARNESSES

Each shoulder harness is attached to a rear doorpost above the window line and is stowed behind a
stowage sheath above the cabin door. To stow the harness, fold it and place it behind the sheath. No
harness is available for the child’s seat.

The shoulder harnesses are used by fastening and adjusting the seat belt first. Then, lengthen the
harness as required by pulling on the connecting link on the end of the harness and the narrow release
strap. Snap the connecting link firmly onto the retaining stud on the seat belt link half. Then adjust to
length. Removing the harness is accomplished by pulling upward on the narrow release strap and
removing the harness connecting link from the stud on the seat belt link. In an emergency, the shoulder
harness may be removed by releasing the seat belt first and allowing the harness, still attached to the
link half of the seat belt, to drop to the side of the seat.

Adjustment of the shoulder harness is important. A properly adjusted harness will permit the occupant
to lean forward enough to sit completely erect, but prevent excessive forward movement and contact
with objects during sudden deceleration. Also, the pilot will want the freedom to reach all controls
easily.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 7-12

```
Figure 7-4. Seat Belts and Shoulder Harnesses
```

### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 7-13

INTEGRATED SEAT BELT/SHOULDER HARNESSES WITH INERTIA REELS

Integrated seat belt/shoulder harnesses with inertia reels are available for the pilot and front seat
passenger. The seat belt/shoulder harnesses extend from inertia reels located in the upper cabin
sidewall just aft of each cabin door to attach points outboard of the front seats. A separate seat belt
half and buckle is located inboard of the seats. Inertia reels allow complete freedom of body
movement. However, in the event of a sudden deceleration, they will lock automatically to protect the
occupants.

To use the seat belt/should harness, position the adjustable metal link on the harness at about shoulder
level, pull the link and harness downward, and insert the link in the seat belt buckle. Adjust belt tension
across the lap by pulling upward on the shoulder harness. Removal is accomplished by releasing the
seat belt buckle, which will allow the inertia reel to pull the harness outboard of the seat.

ENTRANCE DOORS AND CABIN WINDOWS

Entry to, and exit from the airplane is accomplished through either of two entry doors, one on each side
of the cabin (refer to Section 6 for cabin and cabin door dimensions). The doors incorporate a recessed
exterior and interior door handle, a key-operated door lock (left door only), a door stop mechanism, and
an openable window.

To open the doors from outside the airplane, utilize the recessed door handle near the aft edge of each
door. Grasp the forward edge of the handle and pull out. To close or open the doors from inside the
airplane, use the recessed door handle and arm rest. Both cabin doors should be checked for security
prior to flight, and should not be opened intentionally during flight.

### NOTE

```
Accidental opening of a cabin door in flight due to improper closing does
not constitute a need to land the airplane. The best procedure is to set
up the airplane in a trimmed condition at approximately 65 knots,
momentarily shove the door outward slightly, and forcefully close the
door.
```
Exit from the airplane is accomplished by grasping the forward edge of the door handle and pulling. To
lock the airplane, lock the right cabin door from the inside by lifting up on the lever near the aft edge of
the door, close the left cabin door, and using the ignition key, lock the door.

Both cabin doors are equipped with openable windows. The windows are held in the closed position by
a detent equipped latch on the lower edge of the window frame. To open either window, rotate the
latch upward. The windows are equipped with a spring-loaded retaining arm which will help rotate the
window outward, and hold it there. If required, the windows may be opened at any speed up to 143
knots. All other cabin windows are of the fixed type and cannot be opened. Two additional fixed
windows may be installed in the cabin top.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 7-14

CONTROL LOCKS

A control lock is provided to lock the ailerons and elevator control surfaces in a neutral position and
prevent damage to these systems by wind buffeting while the airplane is parked. The lock consists of a
shaped steel rod with a red metal flag attached to it. The flag is labeled CONTROL LOCK, REMOVE
BEFORE STARTING ENGINE. To install the control lock, align the hole in the top of the pilot’s control
wheel shaft with the hole in the top of the shaft collar on the instrument panel and insert the rod into
the aligned holes. Proper installation of the lock will place the red flag over the ignition switch. In areas
where high or gusty winds occur, a control surface lock should be installed over the vertical stabilizer
and rudder. The control lock and any other type of locking device should be removed prior to starting
the engine.

ENGINE

The airplane is powered by a horizontally-opposed, four-cylinder, overhead-valve, air-cooled, carbureted
engine with a wet sump oil system. The engine is a Lycoming Model O-235-L2C and is rated at 110
horsepower at 2550 RPM. Major engine accessories (mounted on the front of the engine) include a
starter, a belt-driven alternator, and an oil cooler. Dual magnetos are mounted on an accessory drive
pad on the rear of the engine. Provisions are also made for a vacuum pump and full flow oil filter.

ENGINE CONTROLS

Engine power is controlled by a throttle located on the lower center portion of the instrument panel.
The throttle operates in a conventional manner; in the full forward position, the throttle is open, and in
the full aft position, it is closed. A friction lock, which is a round knurled disk, is located at the base of
the throttle and is operated by rotating the lock clockwise to increase friction or counterclockwise to
decrease it.

The mixture control, mounted above the right corner of the control pedestal, is a red knob with raised
points around the circumference and is equipped with a lock button in the end of the knob. The rich
position is full forward, and full aft is the idle cut-off position. For small adjustments, the control may be
moved forward by rotating the knob clockwise, and aft by rotating the knob counterclockwise. For rapid
or large adjustments, the knob may be moved forward or aft by depressing the lock button in the end of
the control, and then positioning the control as desired.

ENGINE INSTRUMENTS

Engine operation is monitored by the following instruments: oil pressure gage, oil temperature gage,
and a tachometer.

The oil pressure gage, located on the subpanel, is operated by oil pressure. A direct pressure oil line
from the engine delivers oil at engine operating pressure to the oil pressure gage. Gage markings
indicate that minimum idling pressure is 25 PSI (red line), the normal operating range is 60 to 90 PSI
(green arc), and maximum pressure is 100 PSI (red line).


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 7-15

Oil temperature is indicated by a gage located on the subpanel. The gage is operated by an electrical-
resistance type temperature sensor which receives power from the airplane electrical system. Oil
temperature limitations are the normal operating range (green arc) which is 38°C (100°F) to 118°C
(245°F), and the maximum (red line) which is 118°C (245°F).

The engine-driven mechanical tachometer is located near the upper center portion of the instrument
panel. The instrument is calibrated in increments of 100 RPM and indicates both engine and propeller
speed. An hour meter below the center of the tachometer dial records elapsed engine time in hours
and tenths. Instrument markings include a normal operating range (green arc) of 1900 to 2550 RPM,
and a maximum (red line) of 2550 RPM.

NEW ENGINE BREAK-IN AND OPERATION

The engine underwent a run-in at the factory and is ready for the full range of use. It is, however,
suggested that cruising be accomplished at 65% to 75% power until a total of 50 hours has accumulated
or oil consumption has stabilized. This will ensure proper seating of the rings.

The airplane is delivered from the factory with corrosion preventive oil in the engine. If, during the first
25 hours, oil must be added, use only aviation grade straight mineral oil conforming to Specification No.
MIL-L -6082.

ENGINE OIL SYSTEM

Oil for engine lubrication is supplied from a sump on the bottom of the engine. The capacity of the
engine sump is six quarts (one additional quart is required if a full flow oil filter is installed). Oil is drawn
from the sump through an oil suction strainer screen into the engine-driven oil pump. From the pump,
oil is routed to a bypass valve. If the oil is cold, the bypass valve allows the oil to bypass the oil cooler
and go directly from the pump to the oil pressure screen (full flow oil filter, if installed). If the oil is hot,
the bypass valve routes the oil out of the accessory housing and into a flexible hose leading to the oil
cooler on the front side of the left forward engine baffle. Pressure oil from the cooler returns to the
accessory housing where it passes through the pressure strainer screen (full flow oil filter, if installed).
The filter oil then enters a pressure relief valve which regulates engine oil pressure by allowing excessive
oil to return to the sump, while the balance of the pressure oil is circulated to various engine parts for
lubrication. Residual oil is returned to the sump by gravity flow.

An oil filter cap/oil dipstick is located at the rear of the engine on the right side. The filler cap/dipstick is
accessible through an access door in the engine cowling. The engine should not be operated on less
than four quarts of oil. To minimize loss of oil through the breather, fill to five quarts for normal flights
of less than three hours. For extended flight, fill to six quarts (dipstick indication only). For engine oil
grade and specifications, refer to Section 8 of this handbook.

An oil quick-drain valve is available to replace the drain plug in the oil sump drain port, and provides
quicker, cleaner draining of the engine oil. To drain the oil with this valve installed, slip a hose over the
end of the valve and push upward on the end of the valve until it snaps into the open position. Spring
clips will hold the valve open. After draining, use a suitable tool to snap the valve into the extended
(closed) position and remove the drain hose.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 7-16

IGNITION-STARTER SYSTEM

Engine ignition is provided by two engine-driven magnetos, and two spark plugs in each cylinder. The
right magneto fires the lower right and the upper left spark plugs, and the left magneto fires the lower
left and upper right spark plugs. Normal operation is conducted with both magnetos due to the more
complete burning of the fuel-air mixture with dual ignition.

Ignition and starter operation is controlled by a rotary type switch located on the left subpanel. The
switch is labeled clockwise, OFF, R, L, BOTH, and START. The engine should be operated on both
magnetos (BOTH position) except for magneto checks. The R and L positions are for checking purposes
and emergency use only. When the switch is rotated to the spring-loaded START position, (with the
master switch in the ON position), the starter contactor is energized and the starter will crank the
engine. When the switch is released, it will automatically return to the BOTH position.

AIR INDUCTION SYSTEM

The engine air induction system receives ram air through an intake in the lower portion of the engine
cowling. The intake is covered by an air filter which removes dust and other foreign matter from the
induction air. Airflow passes through the filter enters an airbox. After passing through the airbox,
induction air enters the inlet in the carburetor which is under the engine, and is then ducted to the
engine cylinders through intake manifold tubes. In the event carburetor ice is encountered or the intake
filter becomes blocked, alternate heated air can be obtained from the muffler shroud through a duct to
a valve, in the airbox, operated by the carburetor heat control on the instrument panel. Heated air from
the muffler shroud is obtained from an unfiltered outside source. Use of full carburetor heat at full
throttle will result in a loss of approximately 150 to 200 RPM.

EXHAUST SYSTEM

Exhaust gas from each cylinder passes through riser assemblies to a muffler and tailpipe on the right
side of the engine. The muffler is constructed with a shroud around the outside which forms a heating
chamber for carburetor heat and cabin heater air.

CARBURETOR AND PRIMING SYSTEM

The engine is equipped with an up-draft, float-type, fixed jet carburetor mounted on the bottom of the
engine. The carburetor has an idle cut-off mechanism and a manual mixture control. Fuel is delivered
to the carburetor by gravity flow from the fuel system. In the carburetor, fuel is atomized,
proportionally mixed with intake air, and delivered to the cylinders through intake manifold tubes. The
proportion of atomized fuel to air is controlled, within limits, by the mixture control on the instrument
panel.

For starting, the engine is equipped with a manual priming system. The primer is actually a small pump
which draws fuel from the fuel strainer when the plunger is pulled out, and injects it into the cylinder
intake ports when the plunger is pushed back in. The plunger knob, on the instrument panel, is
equipped with a lock and, after being pushed full in, must be rotated either left or right until the knob
cannot be pulled out.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 7-17

COOLING SYSTEM

Ram air for engine cooling enters through two intake openings in the front of the engine cowling. The
cooling air is directed around the cylinders and other areas of the engine by baffling, and is then
exhausted through an opening at the bottom aft edge of the cowling. No manual cooling system control
is provided.

A winterization kit is available for the airplane. The kit consists of two cover plates to partially cover the
cowl nose cap opening, two placards to be installed on the cover plates, insulation for the engine
crankcase breather line, and a placard to be installed on the map compartment door. This equipment
should be installed for operations in temperatures consistently below -7°C (20°F). Once installed, the
crankcase breather insulation is approved for permanent use regardless of temperature.

PROPELLER

The airplane is equipped with a two-bladed, fixed-pitch, one-piece forged aluminum alloy propeller
which is anodized to retard corrosion. The propeller is 69 inches in diameter.

FUEL SYSTEM

The airplane may be equipped with either a standard fuel system or long range system (see figure 7-6).
Both systems consist of two vented fuel tanks (one in each wing), a fuel shutoff valve, fuel strainer,
manual primer, and carburetor. Refer to figure 7-5 for fuel quantity data for both systems.

Figure 7-5. Fuel Quantity Data
```
Fuel flows by gravity from the two wing tanks to a fuel shutoff valve. With the valve in the ON position,
fuel flows through a strainer to the carburetor. From the carburetor, mixed fuel and air flows to the
cylinders through intake manifold tubes. The manual primer draws its fuel from the fuel strainer and
injects in into the cylinder intake ports.

Fuel system venting is essential to system operation. Blockage of the venting system will result in a
decreased fuel flow and eventual engine stoppage. Venting is accomplished by an interconnecting line
from the right fuel tank to the left tank. The left tank is vented overboard through a vent line which is


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 7-18

equipped with a check valve, and protrudes from the bottom surface of the left wing near the wing strut
attach point. The right fuel tank filler cap is also vented.

Fuel quantity is measured by two float-type fuel quantity transmitters (one in each tank) and indicated
by two electrically-operated fuel quantity indicators on the lower left portion of the instrument panel.

```
Figure 7-6. Fuel System (Standard and Long Range)
```

### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 7-19

An empty tank is indicated by a red line and the letter E. When an indicator shows an empty tank,
approximately .75 gallon remains in either a standard or long range tank as unusable fuel. The
indicators cannot be relied upon for accurate readings during skids, slips, or unusual attitudes.

The amount of unusable fuel is relatively small due to the dual outlets at each tank. The maximum
unusable fuel quantity, as determined from the most critical flight condition, is about 1.5 gallons total.
This quantity was not exceeded by any other reasonable flight condition, including prolonged 30 second
full-rudder sideslips in the landing configuration. Takeoffs have not been demonstrated with less than 2
gallons total fuel (1 gallon per tank).

The fuel system is equipped with drain valves to provide a means for the examination of fuel in the
system for contamination and grade. The system should be examine before the first flight of every day
and after each refueling, by using the sampler cup provided to drain fuel from the wing tank sumps, and
by utilizing the fuel strainer drain under an access panel on the right side of the engine cowling. The fuel
tanks should be filled after each flight to prevent condensation.

When the airplane is equipped with long range tanks, it may be serviced to a reduced fuel capacity to
permit heavier cabin loadings. This is accomplished by filling each tank to the bottom of the indicator on
the fuel filler neck. When filled to this level, the tank contains 12 gallons (12.25 usable in all flight
conditions).

BRAKE SYSTEM

The airplane has a single-disc, hydraulically-actuated brake on each main landing gear wheel. Each
brake is connected, by a hydraulic line, to a master cylinder attached to each of the pilot’s rudder
pedals. The brakes are operated by applying pressure to the top of either the left (pilot’s) or right
(copilot’s) set of rudder pedals, which are interconnected. When the airplane is parked, both main
wheel brakes may be set by utilizing the parking brake which is operated by a knob on the lower left side
of the instrument panel.

For maximum brake life, keep the brake system properly maintained, and minimize brake usage during
taxi operations and landings.

Some of the symptoms of impending brake failure are: gradual decrease in braking action after brake
application, noisy or dragging brakes, soft or spongy pedals, and excessive travel and weak braking
action. If any of these symptoms appear, the brake system is in need of immediate attention. If, during
taxi or landing roll, braking action decreases, let up on the pedals and then re-apply the brakes with
heavy pressure. If the brakes become spongy or pedal travel increases, pumping the pedals should build
braking pressure. If one brake becomes weak or fails, use the other brake sparingly while using opposite
rudder, as required, to offset the good brake.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 7-20

ELECTRICAL SYSTEM

Electrical energy (see figure 7-7) is supplied by a 28-volt, direct-current system powered by an engine-
driven, 60-amp alternator and a 24-volt, 14-amp hour battery (or 17-amp hour battery, if installed)
located on the right forward side of the firewall. Power is supplied through a single bus bar; a master
switch controls this power to all circuits, except the engine ignition system, clock, or flight hour recorder
(if installed). The flight hour recorder receives power through activation of an oil pressure switch
whenever the engine is operating, and the clock is supplied with current at all times. All avionics
equipment should be turned off prior to starting the engine or using an external power source to
prevent harmful transient voltages from damaging the transistors in this equipment.

MASTER SWITCH

The master switch is a split-rocker type switch labeled MASTER, and is ON in the up position and OFF in
the down position. The right half of the switch, labeled BAT, controls all electrical power to the airplane.
The left half, labeled ALT, controls the alternator.

Normally, both sides of the master switch should be used simultaneously; however, the BAT side of the
switch could be turned ON separately to check equipment while on the ground. The ALT side of the
switch, when placed in the OFF position, removes the alternator from the electrical system. With this
switch in the OFF position, the entire electrical load is placed on the battery. Continued operation with
the alternator switch in the OFF position will reduce battery power low enough to open the battery
contactor, remove power from the alternator field, and prevent alternator restart.

AMMETER

The ammeter indicates the flow of current, in amperes, from the alternator to the battery or from the
battery to the airplane electrical system. When the engine is operating and the master switch is turned
on, the ammeter indicates the charging rate applied to the battery. In the event the alternator is not
functioning or the electrical load exceeds the output of the alternator, the ammeter indicates the
battery discharge rate.

OVER-VOLTAGE SENSOR AND WARNING LIGHT

The airplane is equipped with an automatic over-voltage protection system consisting of an over-voltage
sensor behind the instrument panel and a red warning light, labeled HIGH VOLTAGE, under the
ammeter.

In the event an over-voltage condition occurs, the over-voltage sensor automatically removes alternator
field current and shuts down the alternator. The red warning light will then turn on, indicating to the
pilot that the alternator is not operating and the battery is supplying all electrical power.

The over-voltage sensor may be reset by turning the master switch off and back on again. If the warning
light does not illuminate, normal alternator charging has resumed; however, if the light does illuminate
again, a malfunction has occurred, and the flight should be terminated as soon as practical.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 7-21

The warning light may be tested by momentarily turning off the ALT portion of the master switch and
leaving the BAT portion turned on.

```
Figure 7-7. Electrical System
```

### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 7-22

CIRCUIT BREAKERS AND FUSES

Most of the electrical circuits in the airplane are protect by “push-to-reset” circuit breakers mounted
under the engine controls on the instrument panel. The cigar lighter is equipped with a manually-reset
type circuit breaker located on the back of the lighter and a fuse behind the instrument panel. The
control wheel map light (if installed) is protected by the NAV/DOME circuit breaker, and a fuse behind
the instrument panel. Electrical circuits which are not protected by circuit breakers are the battery
contactor closing (external power) circuit, clock circuit, and flight hour recorder circuit. These circuits
are protected by fuses mounted adjacent to the battery.

GROUND SERVICE PLUG RECEPTACLE

A ground service plug receptacle may be installed to permit the use of an external power source for cold
weather starting and during lengthy maintenance work on the electrical and electronic equipment. The
receptacle is located behind a door on the left side of the fuselage near the aft edge of the cowling.

Just before connecting an external power source (generator type or battery cart), the master switch
should be turned ON. This is especially important since it will enable the battery to absorb transient
voltages which otherwise might damage the transistors in the electronic equipment.

The battery and external power circuits have been designed to completely eliminate the need to
“jumper” across the battery contactor to close it for charging a complete “dead” battery. A special
fused circuit in the external power system supplies the needed “jumper” across the contacts so that
with a ‘dead” battery and an external power source applied, turning the master switch ON will close the
battery contactor.

LIGHTING SYSTEM

EXTERIOR LIGHTING

Conventional navigation lights are located on the wing tips and top of the rudder, a single landing light is
installed in the cowl nose cap, and a flashing beacon is mounted on top of the vertical fin. Additional
lighting is available and includes dual landing/taxi lights in the cowl nose cap and a strobe light on each
wing tip. All exterior lights are controlled by rocker type switches on the lower left side of the
instrument panel. The switches are ON in the up position and OFF in the down position.

The flashing beacon should not be used when flying through clouds or overcast; the flashing light
reflected from water droplets or particles in the atmosphere, particularly at night, can produce vertigo
and loss of orientation.

The high intensity strobe lights will enhance anti-collision protection. However, the lights should be
turned off when taxiing in the vicinity of other airplanes, or during night flight through clouds, fog or
haze.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 7-23

INTERIOR LIGHTING

Instrument and control panel lighting is provided by flood lighting and integral lighting. Two concentric
rheostat control knobs on the lower left side of the instrument panel, labeled PANEL LT, and RADIO LT,
control the intensity of both flood and integral lighting.

Instrument and control panel flood lighting consists of a single red flood light in the forward part of the
overhead console. To use the flood lighting, rotate the PANEL LT rheostat control knob clockwise to the
desired intensity.

The radio equipment and magnetic compass have integral lighting. The light intensity of all integral
lighting is controlled by the RADIO LT rheostat control knob.

A cabin dome light is located in the aft part of the overhead console, and is operated by a switch on the
lower portion of the instrument panel. To turn the light on, place the switch in the ON position.

A control wheel map light is available and is mounted on the bottom of the pilot’s control wheel. The
light illuminates the lower portion of the cabin just forward of the pilot and is helpful when checking
maps and other flight data during night operations. To operate the light, first turn on the NAV LIGHTS
switch; then adjust the map light’s intensity with the knurled disk type rheostat control located at the
bottom of the control wheel.

The most probable cause of a light failure is a burned out bulb; however, in the event any of the lighting
systems fail to illuminate when turned on, check the appropriate circuit breaker. If the circuit breaker
has opened (white button popped out), and there is no obvious indication of a short circuit (smoke or
odor), turn off the light switch of the affected lights, reset the breaker, and turn the switch on again. If
the breaker opens again, do not reset it.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 7-24

CABIN HEATING, VENTILATING AND DEFROSTING SYSTEM

The temperature and volume of airflow into the cabin can be regulated to any degree desired by
manipulation of the push-pull CABIN HT and CABIN AIR control knobs (see figure 7-8).

```
Figure 7-8. Cabin Heating, Ventilating, and Defrosting System
```

### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 7-25

Heated fresh air and outside air are blended in a cabin manifold just aft of the firewall by adjustment of
the heat and air controls; this air is then vented into the cabin from outlets in the cabin manifold near
the pilot’s and passenger’s feet. Windshield defrost air is also supplied by a duct leading from the
manifold.

Full ventilation air may be obtained by utilization of the adjustable ventilators near the upper left and
right corners of the windshield, and by pulling the CABIN AIR control knob out. The CABIN HT control
knob must be pushed full in.

PITOT-STATIC SYSTEM AND INSTRUMENTS

The pitot-static system supplies ram air pressure to the airspeed indicator and static pressure to the
airspeed indicator, rate-of-climb indicator and altimeter. The system is composed of either an unheated
or heated pitot tube mounted on the lower surface of the left wing, an external static port on the lower
left side of the forward fuselage, and the associated plumbing necessary to connect the instruments to
the sources.

The heated pitot system consists of a heating element in the pitot tube, a rocker-type switch labeled
PITOT HT on the lower left side of the instrument panel, a 15-amp circuit breaker under the engine
controls on the instrument panel, and associated wiring. When the pitot heat switch is turned on, the
element in the pitot tube is heated electrically to maintain proper operation in possible icing conditions.
Pitot heat should be used only as required.

AIRSPEED INDICATOR

The airspeed indicator is calibrated in knots and miles per hour. Limitation and range markings include
the white arc (35 to 85 knots), green arc (40 to 111 knots), yellow arc (111 to 149 knots), and a red line
(149 knots).

If a true airspeed indicator is installed, it is equipped with a rotatable ring which works in conjunction
with the airspeed indicator dial in a manner similar to the operation of a flight computer. To operate
the indicator, first rotate the ring until **pressure** altitude is aligned with outside air temperature in
degrees Fahrenheit. Pressure altitude should not be confused with indicated altitude. To obtain
pressure altitude, momentarily set the barometric scale on the altimeter to 29.92 and read pressure
altitude on the altimeter. Be sure to return the altimeter barometric scale to the original barometric
setting after pressure altitude has been obtained. Having set the ring to correct for altitude and
temperature, read the true airspeed shown on the rotatable ring by the indicator pointer. For best
accuracy, the indicated airspeed should be corrected to calibrated airspeed by referring to the Airspeed
Calibration chart in Section 5. Knowing the calibrated airspeed, read true airspeed on the ring opposite
the calibrated airspeed.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 7-26

RATE-OF-CLIMB INDICATOR

The rate-of-climb indicator depicts airplane rate of climb or descent in feet per minute. The pointer is
actuated by atmospheric pressure changes resulting from changes of altitude as supplied by the static
source.

ALTIMETER

Airplane altitude is depicted by a barometric type altimeter. A knob near the lower left portion of the
indicator provides adjustment of the instrument’s barometric scale to the current altimeter setting.

VACUUM SYSTEM AND INSTRUMENTS

An engine-driven vacuum system (see figure 7-9) is available and provides the suction necessary to
operate the attitude indicator and directional indicator. The system consists of a vacuum pump
mounted on the engine, a vacuum relief valve and vacuum system air filter on the aft side of the firewall
below the instrument panel, and instruments (including a suction gage) on the left side of the
instrument panel.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 7-27

```
Figure 7-9. Vacuum System
```
ATTITUDE INDICATOR

An attitude indicator is available and gives a visual indication of flight attitude. Bank attitude is
presented by a pointer at the top of the indicator relative to the bank scale which has index marks at
10°, 20°, 30°, 60°, and 90° either side of the center mark. Pitch and roll attitudes are presented by a
miniature airplane in relation to the horizontal bar. A knob at the bottom of the instrument is provided


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 7-28

for in-flight adjustment of the miniature airplane to the horizon bar for a more accurate flight attitude
indication.

DIRECTIONAL INDICATOR

A directional indicator is available and displays airplane heading on a compass card in relation to a fixed
simulated airplane image and index. The directional indicator will precess slightly over a period of time.
Therefore, the compass card should be set in accordance with the magnetic compass just prior to
takeoff, and occasionally re-adjusted on extended flights. A knob on the lower left edge of the
instrument is used to adjust the compass card to correct for any prcession.

SUCTION GAGE

A suction gage is located on the left side of the instrument panel when the airplane is equipped with a
vacuum system. Suction available for operation of the attitude indicator and directional indicator is
shown by this gage, which is calibrated in inches of mercury. The desired suction range is 4.6 to 5.4
inches of mercury. A suction reading below this range may indicate a system malfunction or improper
adjustment, and in this case, the indicators should not be considered reliable.

STALL WARNING SYSTEM

The airplane is equipped with a pneumatic-type stall warning system consisting of an inlet in the leading
edge of the left wing, an air-operated horn near the upper left corner of the windshield, and associated
plumbing. As the airplane approaches a stall, the low pressure on the upper surface of the wings moves
forward around the leading edge of the wings. This low pressure creates a differential pressure in the
stall warning system which draws air through the warning horn, resulting in an audible warning at 5 to
10 knots above stall in all flight conditions.

The stall warning system should be checked during the preflight inspection by placing a clean
handkerchief over the vent opening and applying suction. A sound from the warning horn will confirm
that the system is operative.

AVIONICS SUPPORT EQUIPMENT

The airplane may, at the owner’s discretion, be equipped with various types of avionics support
equipment such as an audio control panel and static dischargers. The following paragraphs discuss
these items.

AUDIO CONTROL PANEL

Operation of radio equipment is covered in Section 9 of this handbook. When one or more radios is
installed, a transmitter/audio switching system is provided (see figure 7-10). The operation of this
switching system is described in the following paragraphs.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 7-29

The transmitter selector switch is labeled TRANS, and has two positions. When two transmitters are
installed, it is necessary to switch the microphone to the radio unit the pilot desires to use for
transmission. This is accomplished by placing the transmitter selector switch in the position
corresponding to the radio unit which is to be used. The up position selects the upper transmitter and
the down position selects the lower transmitter.

The installation of Kitfox radio equipment provides certain audio back-up capabilities and transmitter
selector switch functions that the pilot should be familiar with. The audio amplifier in the NAV/COM
radio is required for speaker and transmitter operation. The amplifier is automatically selected, along
with the transmitter, by the transmitter selector switch. As an example, if the number 1 transmitter is
selected, the audio amplifier in the associated NAV/COM receiver is also selected, and functions as the
amplified for ALL speaker audio. In the event the audio amplifier in use fails, as evidenced by loss of all
speaker audio and transmitting capability of the selected transmitter, select the other transmitter. This
should re-establish speaker audio and transmitter operation. Since headset audio is not affected by
audio amplifier operation, the pilot should be aware that, while utilizing a headset, the only indication of
audio amplifier failure is loss of the selected transmitter. This can be verified by switching to the
speaker function.

The speaker-phone switches determine whether the output of the receiver in use is fed to the
headphones or through the audio amplifier to the speaker. Place the switch for the desired receiving
system either in the up position for speaker operation or in the down position for headphones. The
center OFF position will remove receiver output to either headphones or the speaker.

```
Figure 7-10. Audio Control Panel
```
Airplanes equipped with any radio other than the Kitfox 300 Nav/Com (Type RT-385A) will not have
sidetone capability (monitoring of the operator’s own voice transmission). If the airplane is equipped
with a Kitfox 300 Nav/Com (Type RT-385A), the radio will have sidetone capabilities and the audio
control panel will include a speaker sidetone volume control knob as illustrated in figure 7-10. Sidetone
will be heard on either the airplane speaker or a headset as selected with the speaker-phone selector
switches. When the speaker position is selected, sidetone audio volume may be controlled by rotating
the SIDETONE VOL control knob clockwise to increase audio volume and counterclockwise to decrease
it. When headphones are in use, sidetone volume cannot be adjusted.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 7-30

STATIC DISCHARGERS

If frequent IFR flights are planned, installation of wick-type static dischargers is recommended to
improve radio communications during flight through dust or various forms of precipitation (rain, snow
or ice crystals). Under these conditions, the build-up and discharge of static electricity from the trailing
edge of the wings, rudder, elevator, propeller tips, and radio antennas can result in loss of usable radio
signals on all communications and navigation radio equipment. Usually the ADF is first to be affected
and VFH communication equipment is the last to be affected.

Installation of static dischargers reduces interference from precipitation static, but it is possible to
encounter severe precipitation static conditions which might cause the loss of radio signals, even with
static dischargers installed. Whenever possible, avoid known severe precipitation areas to prevent loss
of dependable radio signals. If avoidance is impractical, minimize airspeed and anticipate temporary
loss of radio signals while in these areas.

in the United States should check with their own aviation officials to determine their individual
requirements.

Kitfox recommends that these items, plus the Pilot’s Operating Handbook, Pilot’s Checklists, Power
Computer, Customer Care Program book and Customer Care Card, be carried in the airplane at all times.

AIRPLANE INSPECTION PERIODS

FAA REQUIRED INSPECTIONS

As required by Federal Aviation Regulations, all civil aircraft of U.S. registry must undergo a complete
inspection (annual) each twelve calendar months. In addition to the required ANNUAL inspection,
aircraft operated commercially (for hire) must have a complete inspection every 100 hours of operation.

The FAA may require other inspections by the issuance of airworthiness directives applicable to the
airplane, engine, propeller and components. It is the responsibility of the owner/operator to ensure
compliance with all applicable airworthiness directives and, when the inspections are repetitive, to take
appropriate steps to prevent inadvertent noncompliance.

In lieu of the 100 HOUR and ANNUAL inspection requirements, an airplane may be inspected in
accordance with a progressive inspection schedule, which allows the work load to be divided into
smaller operations that can be accomplished in shorter time periods.

The KITFOX PROGRESSIVE CARE PROGRAM has been developed to provide a modern progressive
inspection schedule that satisfies the complete airplane inspection requirements of both the 100 HOUR
and ANNUAL inspections as applicable to Kitfox airplanes. The program assists the owner in his
responsibility to comply with all FAA inspection requirements, while ensuring timely replacement of life-
limited parts and adherence to factory-recommended inspection intervals and maintenance procedures.

KITFOX PROGRESSIVE CARE

The Kitfox Progressive Care Program has been designed to help you realize maximum utilization of your
airplane at a minimum cost and downtime. Under this program, the inspection and maintenance work
load is divided into smaller operations that can be accomplished in shorter time periods. The operations
are recorded in a specially provided Aircraft Inspection Log as each operation is conducted.

While Progressive Care may be used on any Kitfox, its benefits depend primarily on utilization (hours
flown per year) and type of operation. The procedures for both the Progressive Care Program and the
100-hour/annual inspection program have been carefully worked out by the factory and are followed by
the Kitfox Dealer Organization. Your Kitfox Dealer can assist you in selecting the inspection program
most suitable for your type of aircraft and operation. The complete familiarity of Kitfox Dealers with
Kitfox equipment and factory-approved procedures provides the highest level of service possible at
lower cost to Kitfox owners.

Regardless of the inspection method selected by the owner, he should keep in mind that FAR Part 43
and FAR Part 91 establishes the requirement that properly certified agencies or personnel accomplish all
required FAA inspections and most of the manufacturer recommended inspections.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 8-6

KITFOX CUSTOMER CARE PROGRAM

Specific benefits and provisions of the KITFOX WARRANTY plus other important benefits for you are
contained in your CUSTOMER CARE PROGRAM book supplied with your airplane. You will want to
thoroughly review your Customer Care Program book and keep it in your airplane at all times.

Coupons attached to the Program book entitle you to an initial inspection and either a Progressive Care
Operation No. 1 or the first 100-hour inspection within the first 6 months of ownership at no charge to
you. If you take delivery from your Dealer, the initial inspection will have been performed before
delivery of the airplane to you. If you pick up your airplane at the factory, plan to take it to your Dealer
reasonably soon after you take delivery, so the initial inspection may be performed allowing the Dealer
to make any minor adjustments which may be necessary.

You will also want to return to your Dealer either for your first Progressive Care Operation, or at 100
hours for your first 100-hour inspection depending on which program you choose to establish for your
airplane. While these important inspections will be performed for you by any Kitfox Dealer, in most
cases you will prefer to have the Dealer from whom you purchased the airplane accomplish this work.

PILOT CONDUCTED PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE

A certified pilot who owns or operates an airplane not used as an air carrier is authorized by FAR Part 43
to perform limited maintenance on his airplane. Refer to FAR Part 43 for a list of the specific
maintenance operations which are allowed.

### NOTE

```
Pilots operating airplanes of other than U.S. registry should refer to the
regulations of the country of certification for information on preventive
maintenance that may be performed by pilots.
```
A Service Manual should be obtained prior to performing any preventive maintenance to ensure that
proper procedures are followed. Your Kitfox Dealer should be contacted for further information or for
required maintenance which must be accomplished by appropriately licensed personnel.

ALTERATIONS OR REPAIRS

It is essential that the FAA be contacted **prior to** any alterations on the airplane to ensure that
airworthiness of the airplane is not violated. Alterations or repairs to the airplane must be
accomplished by licensed personnel.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 8-7

GROUND HANDLING

TOWING

The airplane is most easily and safely maneuvered by hand with the tow-bar attached to the nose
wheel. When towing with a vehicle, do not exceed the nose gear turning angle of 30° either side of
center, or damage to the gear will result. If the airplane is towed or pushed over a rough surface during
hangaring, watch that the normal cushioning action of the nose strut does not cause excessive vertical
movement of the tail and the resulting contact with low hangar doors or structure. A flat nose tire or
deflated strut will also increase tail height.

PARKING

When parking the airplane, head into the wind and set the parking brakes. Do not set the parking
brakes during cold weather when accumulated moisture may freeze the brakes, or when the brakes are
overheated. Install the control wheel lock and chock the wheels. In severe weather and high wind
conditions, tie the airplane down as outlined in the following paragraph.

TIE-DOWN

Proper tie-down procedure is the best precaution against damage to the parked airplane by gusty or
strong wings. To tie-down the airplane securely, proceed as follows:

1. Set the parking brake and install the control wheel lock.
2. Install a surface control lock between each aileron and flap.
3. Tie sufficiently strong ropes or chains (700 pounds tensile strength) to the wing and tail tie-
    down fittings and secure each rope to a ramp tie-down.
4. Install a surface control lock over the fin and rudder.
5. Tie a rope (no chains or cables) to an exposed portion of the engine mount and secure to a ramp
    tie-down.
6. Install a pitot tube cover.

JACKING

When a requirement exists to jack the entire airplane off the ground, or when wing jack points are used
in the jacking operation, refer to the Service Manual for specific procedures and equipment required.

Individual main gear may be jacked by using the jack pad which is incorporated in the main landing gear
strut step bracket. When using the individual gear strut jack pad, flexibility of the gear strut will cause
the main wheel to slide inboard as the wheel is raised, tilting the jack. The jack must then be lowered
for a second jacking operation. **Do not** jack both main wheels simultaneously using the individual main
gear jack pads.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 8-8

If nose gear maintenance is required, the nose wheel may be raised off the ground by pressing down on
a tailcone bulkhead, just forward of the horizontal stabilizer, and allowing the tail to rest on the tail tie-
down ring.

```
NOTE
Do not apply pressure on the elevator or outboard stabilizer surfaces.
When pushing on the tailcone, always apply pressure at a bulkhead to
avoid buckling the skin.
```
To assist in raising and holding the nose wheel off the ground, weight down the tail by placing sand-
bags, or suitable weight, on each side of the horizontal stabilizer, next to the fuselage. If ground anchors
are available, the tail should be securely tied down.

### NOTE

```
Ensure that the nose will be held off the ground under all conditions by
means of suitable stands or supports under weight supporting
bulkheads near the nose of the airplane.
```
LEVELING

Longitudinal leveling of the airplane is accomplished by placing a level on leveling screws located at
stations 94.63 and 132.94 on the left side of the tailcone. Deflate the nose tire and/or lower or raise the
nose strut to properly center the bubble in the level. Corresponding points on both upper door sills may
be used to level the airplane laterally.

FLYABLE STORAGE

Airplanes placed in non-operational storage for a maximum of 30 days or those which receive only
intermittent operational use for the first 25 hours are considered in flyable storage status. Every
seventh day during these periods, the propeller should be rotated by hand through five revolutions.
This action “limbers” the oil and prevents any accumulation of corrosion on engine cylinder walls.

### WARNING

```
For maximum safety, check that the ignition switch is OFF, the throttle is
closed, the mixture control is in the idle cut-off position, and the
airplane is secured before rotating the propeller by hand. Do not stand
within the arc of the propeller blades while turning the propeller.
```
After 30 days, the airplane should be flown for 30 minutes or a ground runup should be made just long
enough to produce an oil temperature within the lower green arc range. Excessive ground runup should
be avoided.

Engine runup also helps to eliminate excessive accumulations of water in the fuel system and other air
spaces in the engine. Keep fuel tanks full to minimize condensation in the tanks. Keep the battery fully
charged to prevent electrolyte from freezing in cold weather. If the airplane is to be stored temporarily,
or indefinitely, refer to the Service Manual for proper storage procedures.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 8-9

SERVICING

In addition to the PREFLIGHT INSPECTION covered in Section 4, COMPLETE servicing, inspection, and test
requirements for your airplane are detailed in the Service Manual. The Service Manual outlines all items
which require attention at specific intervals plus those items which require servicing, inspection, and/or
testing at special intervals.

Since Kitfox Dealers conduct all service, inspection, and test procedures in accordance with applicable
Service Manuals, it is recommended that you contact your Kitfox Dealer concerning these
requirements and begin scheduling your airplane for service at the recommended intervals.

Kitfox Progressive Care ensures that these requirements are accomplished at the required intervals to
comply with the 100-hour or ANNUAL inspection as previously covered.

Depending on various flight operations, your local Government Aviation Agency may require additional
service, inspections, or tests. For these regulatory requirements, owners should check with local
aviation officials where the airplane is being operated.

For quick and ready reference, quantities, materials, and specifications for frequently used service items
are as follows.

ENGINE OIL

### GRADE AND VISCOSITY FOR TEMPERATURE RANGE –

The airplane was delivered from the factory with a corrosion preventive aircraft engine oil. This oil
should be drained after the first 25 hours of operation, and the following oils used as specified for the
average ambient air temperature in the operating area.

MIL-L -6082 Aviation Grade Straight Mineral Oil: Use to replenish supply during the first 25 hours and at
the first 25-hour oil change. Continue to use until a total of 50 hours has accumulated or oil
consumption has stabilized.

```
SAE 50 above 16°C (60°F)
SAE 40 between -1°C (30°F) and 32°C (90°F)
SAE 30 between -18°C (0°F) and 21°C (70°F)
SAE 20 below -12°C (10°F)
```
MIL-L -22851 Ashless Dispersant Oil: This oil **must be used** after the first 50 hours or oil consumption has
stabilized.

```
SAE 40 or SAE 50 above 16°C (60°F)
SAE 40 between -1°C (30°F) and 32°C (90°F)
SAE 30 or SAE 40 between -18°C (0°F) and 21°C (70°F)
SAE 30 below -12°C (10°F)
```

### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 8-10

CAPACITY OF ENGINE SUMP – 6 Quarts
Do not operate on less than 4 quarts. To minimize loss of oil through breather, fill to 5 quart level for
normal flights of less than 3 hours. For extended flight, fill to 6 quarts. These quantities refer to oil
dipstick level readings. During oil and oil filter changes, one additional quart is required when the filter
is changed.

### OIL AND OIL FILTER CHANGE –

After the first 25 hours of operation, drain the engine oil sump and oil cooler and clean the oil pressure
screen. If an oil filter is installed, change the filter at this time. Refill sump with straight mineral oil and
use until a total of 50 hours has accumulated or oil consumption has stabilized; then change to
dispersant oil.

On airplanes **not** equipped with an oil filter, drain the engine oil sump and oil cooler and clean the oil
pressure screen each 50 hours thereafter.

On airplanes **which have** an oil filter; after the first 50 hours, change to dispersant oil and change the
filter. Repeat every 100 hours thereafter.

Change engine oil at least every 6 months even though less than the recommended hours have
accumulated. Reduce intervals for prolonged operation in dusty areas, cold climates, or when short
flights and long idle periods result in sludging conditions.

### NOTE

```
During the first 25-hour oil and filter change, a general inspection of the
overall engine compartment is required. Items which are not normally
checked during a preflight inspection should be given special attention.
Hoses, metal lines and fittings should be inspected for signs of oil and
fuel leaks, and checked for abrasions, chafing, security, proper routing
and support, and evidence of deterioration. Inspect the intake and
exhaust systems for cracks, evidence of leakage, and security of
attachment. Engine controls and linkages should be checked for
freedom of movement through their full range, security of attachment,
and evidence of wear. Inspect wiring for security, chafing, burning,
defective insulation, loose or broken terminals, heat deterioration, and
corroded terminals. A periodic check of these items during subsequent
servicing operations is recommended.
```

### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 8-12

CLEANING AND CARE

WINDSHIELD-WINDOWS

The plastic windshield and windows should be cleaned with an aircraft windshield cleaner. Apply the
cleaner sparingly with soft cloths, and rub with moderate pressure until all dirt, oil scum and bug stains
are removed. Allow the cleaner to dry, then wipe it off with soft flannel cloths.

If a windshield cleaner is not available, the plastic can be cleaned with soft cloths moistened with
Stoddard solvent to remove oil and grease.

### NOTE

```
Never use gasoline, benzine, alcohol, acetone, carbon tetrachloride, fire
extinguisher or anti-ice fluid, lacquer thinner or glass cleaner to clean
the plastic. These materials will attack the plastic and may cause it to
craze.
```
Follow by **carefully** washing with a mild detergent and plenty of water. Rinse thoroughly, then dry with
a clean moist chamois. **Do not rub** the plastic with a dry cloth since this builds up an electrostatic charge
which attracts dust. Waxing with a good commercial wax will finish the cleaning job. A thin, even coat
of wax, polished out by hand with clean soft flannel cloths, will fill in minor scratches and help prevent
further scratching.

**Do not use** a canvas cover on the windshield unless freezing rain or sleet is anticipated since the cover
may scratch the plastic surface.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 8-13

PAINTED SURFACES

The painted exterior surfaces of your new Kitfox have a durable, long lasting finish and, under normal
conditions, require no polishing or buffing. Approximately 15 days are required for the paint to cure
completely; in most cases, the curing period will have been completed prior to delivery of the airplane.
In the event that polishing or buffing is required within the curing period, it is recommended that the
work be done by someone experienced in handling uncured paint. Any Kitfox Dealer can accomplish
this work.

Generally, the painted surfaces can be kept bright by washing with water and mild soap, followed by a
rinse with water and drying with cloths or a chamois. Harsh or abrasive soaps or detergents which cause
corrosion or scratches should never be used. Remove stubborn oil and grease with a cloth moistened
with Stoddard solvent.

Waxing is unnecessary to keep the paint surfaces bright. However, if desired, the airplane may be
waxed with a good automotive wax. A heavier coating of wax on the leading edge of the wings and tail
and on the engine nose cap and propeller spinner will help reduce the abrasion encountered in these
areas.

When the airplane is parked outside in cold climates and it is necessary to remove ice before flight, care
should be taken to protect the painted surfaces during ice removal with chemical liquids. A 50-50
solution of isopropyl alcohol and water will satisfactorily remove ice accumulations without damaging
the paint. A solution with more than 50% alcohol is harmful and should be avoided. While applying the
de-icing solution, keep it away from the windshield and cabin windows since the alcohol will attack the
plastic and may cause it to craze.

PROPELLER CARE

Preflight inspection of propeller blades for nicks, and wiping them occasionally with an oily cloth to
clean off grass and bug stains will assure long, trouble-free service. Small nicks on the propeller,
particularly near the tips and on the leading edges, should be dressed out as soon as possible since
these nicks produce stress concentrations, and if ignored, may result in cracks. Never use an alkaline
cleaner on the blades; remove grease and dirt with carbon tetrachloride or Stoddard solvent.

ENGINE CARE

The engine may be cleaned with Stoddard solvent, or equivalent, then dried thoroughly.

### CAUTION

```
Particular care should be given to electrical equipment before cleaning.
Cleaning fluids should not be allowed to enter magnetos, starter,
alternator and the like. Protect these components before saturating the
engine with solvents. All other openings should also be covered before
cleaning the engine assembly. Caustic cleaning solutions should be used
cautiously and should always be properly neutralized after their use.
```

### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 8-14

INTERIOR CARE

To remove dust and loose dirt from the upholstery and carpet, clean the interior regularly with a
vacuum cleaner.

Blot up any spilled liquid promptly with cleansing tissue or rags. Don’t pat the spot; press the blotting
material firmly and hold it for several seconds. Continue blotting until no more liquid is taken up.
Scrape off sticky materials with a dull knife, then spot-clean the area.

Oily spots may be cleaned with household spot removers, used sparingly. Before using any solvent, read
the instructions on the container and test it on an obscure place on the fabric to be cleaned. Never
saturate the fabric with a volatile solvent; it may damage the padding and backing materials.

Soiled upholstery and carpet may be cleaned with foam-type detergent, used according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. To minimize wetting the fabric, keep the foam as dry as possible and
remove it with a vacuum cleaner.

The plastic trim, headliner, instrument panel and control knobs need only be wiped off with a damp
cloth. Oil and grease on the control wheel and control knobs can be removed with a cloth moistened
with Stoddard solvent. Volatile solvents, such as mentioned in paragraphs on care of the windshield,
must never be used since they soften and craze the plastic.

INTRODUCTION

This section consists of a series of supplements, each coveting a single optional system which may be
installed in the airplane. Each supplement contains a brief description, and when applicable, operating
limitations, emergency and normal procedures, and performance. Other routinely installed items of
optional equipment, whose function and operational procedures do not require detailed instructions,
are discussed in Section 7.

### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 9-7

SUPPLEMENT

EMERGENCY LOCATOR TRANSMITTER (ELT)

SECTION 1 – GENERAL

The ELT consists of a self-contained dual-frequency radio transmitter and battery power supply, and is
activated by an impact of 5G or more as may be experienced in a crash landing. The ELT emits an omni-
directional signal on the international distress frequencies of 121.5 and 243.0 MHz. (Some ELT units in
export aircraft transmit only on 121.5 MHz.) General aviation and commercial aircraft, the FAA, and CAP
monitor 121.5 MHz, and 243.0 MHz is monitored by the military. Following a crash landing, the ELT will
provide line-of-sight transmission up to 100 miles at 10,000 feet. The ELT supplied in domestic aircraft
transmits on both distress frequencies simultaneously at 75 mw rated power output for 48 continuous
hours in the temperature range of -40°F to +131°F (-40°C to +55°C). The ELT unit in export aircraft
transmits on 121.5 MHz at 25 mw rated power output for 100 continuous hours in the temperature
range of -40°F to +131°F (-40°C to +55°C).

The ELT is readily identified as a bright orange unit mounted behind the baggage compartment wall in
the tailcone. To gain access to the unit, remove the baggage compartment wall. The ELT is operated by
a control panel at the forward facing end of the unit (see figure 1.)


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 9-8

```
ON Activates transmitter instantly. Used for test purposes and if “G” switch is
inoperative.
```
```
OFF Deactivates transmitter. Used during shipping, storage and following rescue.
```
```
AUTO Activates transmitter only when “G” switch receives 5G or more impact.
```
2. COVER – Removable for access to battery pack.
3. ANTENNA RECEPTACLE – Connects to antenna mounted on top of tailcone.

SECTION 2 – LIMITATIONS

There is no change to the airplane limitations when this equipment is installed.

SECTION 3 – EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

Immediately after a forced landing where emergency assistance is required, the ELT should be utilized as
follows:

1. ENSURE ELT ACTIVATION – Turn a radio transceiver ON and select 121.5 MHz. If the ELT can be
    heard transmitting, it was activated by the “G” switch and is functioning properly. If no
    emergency tone is audible, gain access to the ELT and place the function selector switch in the
    ON position.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 9-9

2. PRIOR TO SIGHTING RESCUE AIRCRAFT – Conserve airplane battery. Do not activate radio
    transceiver.
3. AFTER SIGHTING RESCUE AIRCRAFT – Place ELT function selector switch in the OFF position,
    preventing radio interference. Attempt contact with rescue aircraft with the radio transceiver
    set to a frequency of 121.5 MHz. If no contact is established, return the function selector switch
    to ON immediately.
4. FOLLOWING RESCUE – Place ELT function selector switch in the OFF position, terminating
    emergency transmission.

SECTION 4 – NORMAL PROCEDURES

As long as the function selector switch remain in the AUTO position, the ELT automatically activates
following an impact of 5G or more over a short period of time.

Following a lightning strike, or an exceptionally hard landing, the ELT may activate although no
emergency exists. To check your ELT for inadvertent activation, select 121.5 MHz on your radio
transceiver and listen for an emergency tone transmission. If the ELT can be heard transmitting, place
the function selector switch in the OFF position and the tone should cease. Immediately place the
function selector switch in the AUTO position to re-set the ELT for normal operation.

SECTION 5 – PERFORMANCE

There is no change to the airplane performance data when this equipment is installed.

SUPPLEMENT

KITFOX 300 NAV/COM (COM/VOR, No LOC – Type RT-308C)

SECTION 1 – GENERAL

The Kitfox 300 Nav/Com (Type RT-308C), shown in Figure 1, consists of a panel-mounted receiver-
transmitter (RT-308C) and a single needle course deviation indicator (IN-514R or IN-514B). The RT-308C
Receiver-Transmitter includes a 360-channel VHF communication receiver-transmitter and a 160-
channel VHF navigation receiver, both of which may be operated simultaneously.

The communication receiver-transmitter receives and transmits signals between 118.00 and 135.95
MHz in 50 kHz steps. The navigation receiver receives and interprets VHF omnidirectional range (VOR)
signals between 108.00 and 117.95 MHz. Although localizer signals (all odd-tenth frequencies between
108.1 and 111.9 MHz) can also be received, the navigation receiver does not include the necessary
circuits to interpret the signals for localizer indications. However, the audio portion of the localizer is
audible so that flight information, such as that broadcast in certain areas on select localizer frequencies
by the Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS), may be heard.

All controls for the Kitfox 300 Nav/Com (Type RT-308C), except the omni bearing selector (OBS), are
mounted on the front panel of the receiver-transmitter. The course selector and the navigation
indicators are included in the course deviation indicator. The communication receiver-transmitter and
the navigation receiver are synthesizer-controlled and are tuned automatically when the frequency is
selected. In addition, when two or more radios are installed, a transmitter selector switch and a
speaker-phone selector switch are provided. Each control function is described in Figure 1.

transmitter and a single- or dual-pointer remote course deviation indicator (CDI). The set includes a
720-channel VHF communication receiver-transmitter and a 200-channel VHF navigation receiver, both
of which may be operated simultaneously.

The communication receiver-transmitter receives and transmits signals between 118.000 and 135.975
MHz in 25-k Hz steps. The navigation receiver receives and interprets VHF omnidirectional and localizer
signals between 108.00 and 117.95 MHz in 50-kHz steps. The communication receiver-transmitter and
the navigation receiver are synthesizer-controlled and are tuned automatically when the frequency is
selected.

A DME receiver-transmitter or a glide slope receiver, or both, may be interconnected with the Kitfox
300 Nav/Com set for automatic selection of the association DME or GS frequency. When a VOR
frequency is selected on the Nav/Com, the associated VORTAC or VOR-DME station frequency will also
be selected automatically; likewise, if a localizer frequency is selected, the associated glide slope
frequency will be selected automatically.

All controls of the Kitfox 300 Nav/Com, except the omni bearing selector knob (OBS), which is located
on the course indicator, are mounted on the front panel of the receiver-transmitter. The course
indicator includes either a single pointer and related OFF flag for VOR/LOC indication only, or dual
pointers and related OFF flags for both VOR/LOC and glide slope indications. The course indicator also
incorporates a back-course lamp (BC) which lights when optional back-course operation is selected.
Each control function is described in Figure 1, and the audio control panel supplied with this equipment
is shown and described in Section 7 of this handbook.

automatically; likewise, if a localizer frequency is selected, the associated glide slope frequency will be
selected automatically.

The course deviation indicator includes either a single-pointer and related NAV flag for VOR/LOC
indication only, or dual pointers and related NAV and GS flags for both VOR/LOC and glide slope
indications. Both types of course deviation indicators incorporate a back-course lamp (BC) which lights
when optional back course (reversed sense) operation is selected. Both types may be provided with
Automatic Radial Centering which, depending on how it is selected, will automatically indicate the
bearing TO or FROM the VOR station.

All controls for the Nav/Com, except the standard omni bearing selector (OBS) knob or the optional
automatic radial centering (ARC) knob located on the course deviation indicator, are mounted on the

KITFOX 300 ADF (Type R-546E)

SECTION 1 – GENERAL

The Kitfox 300 ADF is a panel-mounted, digitally tuned automatic direction finder. It is designed to
provide continuous 1 kHz digital tuning in the frequency range of 200 kHz to 1,699 kHz and eliminates
the need for mechanical band switching. The system is comprised of a receiver, loop antenna, bearing
indicator and a sense antenna. In addition, when two or more radios are installed, speaker-phone
selector switches are provided. Each control function is described in Figure 1.

The Kitfox 300 ADF can be used for position plotting and homing procedures, and for aural reception of
amplitude-modulated (AM) signals.

With the function selector knob at ADF, the Kitfox 300 ADF provides a visual indication, on the bearing
indicator, of the bearing to the transmitting station relative to the nose of the airplane. This is done by
combining signals from the sense antenna with signals from the loop antenna.

With the function selector knob at REC, the Kitfox 300 ADF uses only the sense antenna and operates
as a conventional low-frequency receiver.

The Kitfox 300 ADF is designed to receive transmission from the following radio facilities: commercial
broadcast stations, low-frequency range stations, FAA radio beacons, and ILS compass locators.

KITFOX 300 TRANSPONDER (Type RT-359A) AND OPTIONAL ENCODING ALTIMETER (Type

EA-401A)

SECTION 1 – GENERAL

The Kitfox 300 Transponder (Type RT-359A), shown in Figure 1, is the airborne component of an Air
Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS). The transponder enables the ATC ground controller to
“see” and identify the aircraft, while in flight, on the control center’s radarscope more readily.

The Kitfox 300 Transponder consists of a panel-mounted unit and an externally-mounted antenna. The
transponder receives interrogating pulse signals on 1030 MHz and transmits coded pulse-train reply
signals on 1090 MHz. It is capable of replying to Mode A (aircraft identification) and Mode C (altitude
reporting) interrogations on a selective reply basis on any of 4,096 information code selections. When
an optional panel-mounted EA-401A Encoding Altimeter (not part of a standard 300 Transponder
system) is included in the avionic configuration, the transponder can provide altitude reporting in 100-
foot increments between -1000 and +35,000 feet.

All Kitfox 300 Transponder operating controls, with the exception of the optional altitude encoder’s

KITFOX 300 TRANSPONDER (Type RT-359A) AND OPTIONAL ALTITUDE ENCODER (BLIND)

SECTION 1 – GENERAL

The Kitfox 300 Transponder (Type RT-359A), shown in Figure 1, is the airborne component of an Air
Traffic Control Radar Beacon System (ATCRBS). The transponder enables ATC ground controller to “see”
and identify the aircraft, while in flight, on the control center’s radarscope more readily.

The Kitfox 300 Transponder system consists of a panel-mounted unit and an externally-mounted
antenna. The transponder receives interrogation pulse signals in 1030 MHz and transmits pulse-train
reply signals on 1090 MHz. The transponder is capable of replying to Mode A (aircraft identification)
and also Mode C (altitude reporting) when coupled to an optional altitude encoder system. The
transponder is capable of replying on both modes of interrogation on a selective reply basis on any of
4,096 information code selections. The optional altitude encoder system (not part of a standard 300
Transponder system) required for Mode C (altitude reporting) operation consists of a completely
independent remote-mounted digitizer that is connected to the static system and supplies encoded
altitude information to the transponder. When the altitude encoder system is coupled to the 300
Transponder system, altitude reporting capabilities are available in 100-foot increments between -1000
and +20,000 feet.

All Kitfox 300 Transponder operating controls are located on the front panel of the unit. Functions of
the operating controls are described in Figure 1.

KITFOX 400 GLIDE SLOPE (Type R-443B)

SECTION 1 – GENERAL

The Kitfox 400 Glide Slope is an airborne navigation receiver which receives and intercepts glide slope
signals from a ground-based Instrument Landing System (ILS). It is used with the localizer function of a
VHF navigation system when making instrument approaches to an airport. The glide slope provides
vertical path guidance while the localizer provides horizontal track guidance.

The Kitfox 400 Glide Slope system consists of a remote-mounted receiver coupled to an existing
navigation system, a panel-mounted indicator and an externally-mounted antenna. The glide slope
receiver is designed to receive ILS glide slope signals on any of 40 channels. The channels are spaced
150 kHz apart and cover a frequency range of 329.15 MHz through 335.0 MHz. When a localizer
frequency is selected on the NAV receiver, the associated glide slope frequency is selected
automatically.

Operation of the Kitfox 400 Glide Slope system is controlled by the associated navigation system. The
functions and indications of typical 300 series glide slope indicators are pictured and described in Figure

1. The 300 series glide slope indicator shown in Figure 1 depict typical indications for all Kitfox-crafted
glide slope indicators. However, refer to the 400 Nav/Com or HSI write-ups if they are listed in this
section as options for additional glide slope indicators.

1. GLIDE SLOPE DEVIATION POINTER – Indicates deviation from normal glide slope.
2. GLIDE SLOPE “OFF” or “GS” FLAG – When visible, indicates unreliable glide slope signal or
    improperly operating equipment. The flag disappears when a reliable glide slope signal is being
    received.

```
CAUTION
Spurious glide slope signals may exist in the area of the localizer back
course approach which can cause the glide slope “OFF” or “GS” flag to
disappear and present unreliable glide slope information. Disregard all
glide slope signal indications when making a localizer back course
approach unless a glide slope (ILS BC) is specified on the approach and
landing chart.

SECTION 2 – LIMITATIONS

There is no change to the airplane limitations when this avionic equipment is installed. However, the
pilot should be aware that on many Kitfox airplanes equipped with the windshield mounted glide slope
antenna, pilots should avoid use of 2700 ±100 RPM on airplanes equipped with two-bladed propeller or
1800 ±100 RPM on airplanes equipped with a three-bladed propeller during ILS approaches to avoid
oscillations of the glide slope deviation pointer caused by propeller interference.

SECTION 3 – EMERGENCY PROCEDURES

There is no change to the airplane emergency procedures when this avionic equipment is installed.


### MODEL SERIES 7 STi 9-51

SECTION 4 – NORMAL PROCEDURES

### TO RECEIVE GLIDE SLOPE SIGNALS:

1. NAV Frequency Select Knobs – SELECT desired localizer frequency (glide slope frequency is
    automatically selected).
2. NAV/COM VOX-ID-T Switch – SELECT ID position to disconnect filter from audio circuit.
3. NAV VOL Control – ADJUST to desired listening level to confirm proper localizer station.

### CAUTION

```
When glide slope “OFF” or “GS” flag is visible, glide slope indications are
unusable.
```
SECTION 5 – PERFORMANCE
